However, most current data pruning algorithms are limited in their ability to preserve accuracy compared to models trained on the full data, especially in high pruning regimes. In this paper we explore the application of data pruning while incorporating knowledge distillation (KD) when training on a pruned subset. That is, rather than relying solely on ground-truth labels, we also use the soft predictions from a teacher network pre-trained on the complete data. By integrating KD into training, we demonstrate significant improvement across datasets, pruning methods, and on all pruning fractions. We first establish a theoretical motivation for employing self-distillation to improve training on pruned data. Then, we empirically make a compelling and highly practical observation: using KD, simple random pruning is comparable or superior to sophisticated pruning methods across all pruning regimes. On ImageNet for example, we achieve superior accuracy despite training on a random subset of only 50% of the data. Additionally, we demonstrate a crucial connection between the pruning factor and the optimal knowledge distillation weight. This helps mitigate the impact of samples with noisy labels and low-quality images retained by typical pruning algorithms. Finally, we make an intriguing observation: when using lower pruning fractions, larger teachers lead to accuracy degradation, while surprisingly, employing teachers with a smaller capacity than the student's may improve results.

The goal is to improve predictive performance of GNN using explanations. EEGL is an iterative self-improving algorithm, which starts with a learned \"vanilla\" GNN, and repeatedly uses frequent subgraph mining to find relevant patterns in explanation subgraphs. These patterns are then filtered further to obtain application-dependent features corresponding to the presence of certain subgraphs in the node neighborhoods.

The backbone technology of tabular synthesizers is rooted in image generative models, ranging from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recent diffusion models. Recent prior work sheds light on the utility-privacy tradeoff on tabular data, revealing and quantifying privacy risks on synthetic data. We first conduct an exhaustive empirical analysis, highlighting the utility-privacy tradeoff of five state-of-the-art tabular synthesizers, against eight privacy attacks, with a special focus on membership inference attacks. Motivated by the observation of high data quality but also high privacy risk in tabular diffusion, we propose DP-TLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-TLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DP-TLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk.","sentences":["Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving data-sharing solution.","Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original data without revealing identifiable private information.","The backbone technology of tabular synthesizers is rooted in image generative models, ranging from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recent diffusion models.","Recent prior work sheds light on the utility-privacy tradeoff on tabular data, revealing and quantifying privacy risks on synthetic data.","We first conduct an exhaustive empirical analysis, highlighting the utility-privacy tradeoff of five state-of-the-art tabular synthesizers, against eight privacy attacks, with a special focus on membership inference attacks.","Motivated by the observation of high data quality but also high privacy risk in tabular diffusion, we propose DP-TLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables.","Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms.","Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-TLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data.","Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DP-TLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07842v1"}

However, their large model sizes hinder their utilization on platforms with limited computational resources. We find that directly using smaller pre-trained models and applying magnitude-based pruning on CLIP models leads to inflexibility and inferior performance. Recent efforts for VLP compression either adopt uni-modal compression metrics resulting in limited performance or involve costly mask-search processes with learnable masks. In this paper, we first propose the Module-wise Pruning Error (MoPE) metric, accurately assessing CLIP module importance by performance decline on cross-modal tasks. Using the MoPE metric, we introduce a unified pruning framework applicable to both pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning compression stages. For pre-training, MoPE-CLIP effectively leverages knowledge from the teacher model, significantly reducing pre-training costs while maintaining strong zero-shot capabilities. For fine-tuning, consecutive pruning from width to depth yields highly competitive task-specific models.

Program invariants can be obtained by various approaches, including lightweight procedures based on data-flow analysis and intensive techniques using Craig interpolation. Although data-flow analysis runs efficiently, it often produces invariants that are too weak to prove the properties. By contrast, interpolation-based approaches build strong invariants from interpolants, but they might not scale well due to expensive interpolation procedures. Invariants can also be injected into model-checking algorithms to assist the analysis. Invariant injection has been studied for many well-known approaches, including k-induction, predicate abstraction, and symbolic execution. We propose an augmented interpolation-based verification algorithm that injects external invariants into interpolation-based model checking (McMillan, 2003), a hardware model-checking algorithm recently adopted for software verification. The auxiliary invariants help prune unreachable states in Craig interpolants and confine the analysis to the reachable parts of a program. We implemented the proposed technique in the verification framework CPAchecker and evaluated it against mature SMT-based methods in CPAchecker as well as other state-of-the-art software verifiers.

The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process. However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.). To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets. A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data. In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance.

{"created":"2024-03-12 16:46:29","title":"Supporting Error Chains in Static Analysis for Precise Evaluation Results and Enhanced Usability","abstract":"Context: Static analyses are well-established to aid in understanding bugs or vulnerabilities during the development process or in large-scale studies. A low false-positive rate is essential for the adaption in practice and for precise results of empirical studies. Unfortunately, static analyses tend to report where a vulnerability manifests rather than the fix location. This can cause presumed false positives or imprecise results. Method: To address this problem, we designed an adaption of an existing static analysis algorithm that can distinguish between a manifestation and fix location, and reports error chains. An error chain represents at least two interconnected errors that occur successively, thus building the connection between the fix and manifestation location. We used our tool CogniCryptSUBS for a case study on 471 GitHub repositories, a performance benchmark to compare different analysis configurations, and conducted an expert interview. Result: We found that 50 % of the projects with a report had at least one error chain. Our runtime benchmark demonstrated that our improvement caused only a minimal runtime overhead of less than 4 %. The results of our expert interview indicate that with our adapted version participants require fewer executions of the analysis.

Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), StyleGaussian achieves style transfer without compromising its real-time rendering ability and multi-view consistency. It achieves instant style transfer with three steps: embedding, transfer, and decoding. Initially, 2D VGG scene features are embedded into reconstructed 3D Gaussians. Next, the embedded features are transformed according to a reference style image. Finally, the transformed features are decoded into the stylized RGB. StyleGaussian has two novel designs. The first is an efficient feature rendering strategy that first renders low-dimensional features and then maps them into high-dimensional features while embedding VGG features. It cuts the memory consumption significantly and enables 3DGS to render the high-dimensional memory-intensive features. The second is a K-nearest-neighbor-based 3D CNN. Working as the decoder for the stylized features, it eliminates the 2D CNN operations that compromise strict multi-view consistency.

However, terrestrial networks are facing a wide range of challenges, from coverage and reliability to interference and congestion. As the demands of the 6G era are expected to be much higher, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for the future. To address these problems, Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) has emerged to be a promising solution. NTNs are communication networks that leverage airborne (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) and spaceborne vehicles (e.g., satellites) to facilitate ultra-reliable communications and connectivity with high data rates and low latency over expansive regions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the utilization of network slicing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) to address diverse challenges of NTNs from the perspectives of both academia and industry.

However, the information captured directly by each camera is siloed, making it difficult to use it effectively. Vehicle re-identification refers to finding a vehicle that appears under one camera in another camera, which can correlate the information captured by multiple cameras. While license plate recognition plays an important role in some applications, there are some scenarios where re-identification method based on vehicle appearance are more suitable. The main challenge is that the data of vehicle appearance has the characteristics of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class differences. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately distinguish between different vehicles by relying only on vehicle appearance information. At this time, it is often necessary to introduce some extra information, such as spatio-temporal information. Nevertheless, the relative position of the vehicles rarely changes when passing through two adjacent cameras in the bridge scenario. In this paper, we present a vehicle re-identification method based on flock similarity, which improves the accuracy of vehicle re-identification by utilizing vehicle information adjacent to the target vehicle. When the relative position of the vehicles remains unchanged and flock size is appropriate, we obtain an average relative improvement of 204% on VeRi dataset in our experiments. Then, the effect of the magnitude of the relative position change of the vehicles as they pass through two cameras is discussed. We present two metrics that can be used to quantify the difference and establish a connection between them. Although this assumption is based on the bridge scenario, it is often true in other scenarios due to driving safety and camera location.","sentences":["Due to the needs of road traffic flow monitoring and public safety management, video surveillance cameras are widely distributed in urban roads.","However, the information captured directly by each camera is siloed, making it difficult to use it effectively.","Vehicle re-identification refers to finding a vehicle that appears under one camera in another camera, which can correlate the information captured by multiple cameras.","While license plate recognition plays an important role in some applications, there are some scenarios where re-identification method based on vehicle appearance are more suitable.","The main challenge is that the data of vehicle appearance has the characteristics of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class differences.","Therefore, it is difficult to accurately distinguish between different vehicles by relying only on vehicle appearance information.","At this time, it is often necessary to introduce some extra information, such as spatio-temporal information.","Nevertheless, the relative position of the vehicles rarely changes when passing through two adjacent cameras in the bridge scenario.","In this paper, we present a vehicle re-identification method based on flock similarity, which improves the accuracy of vehicle re-identification by utilizing vehicle information adjacent to the target vehicle.","When the relative position of the vehicles remains unchanged and flock size is appropriate, we obtain an average relative improvement of 204% on VeRi dataset in our experiments.","Then, the effect of the magnitude of the relative position change of the vehicles as they pass through two cameras is discussed.","We present two metrics that can be used to quantify the difference and establish a connection between them.","Although this assumption is based on the bridge scenario, it is often true in other scenarios due to driving safety and camera location."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07752v1"}

However, several studies have revealed that these models are not effective for everyone due to the imbalanced geographical and economic representation of the data used in the training process. Most of this data comes from Western countries, leading to poor results for underrepresented countries. To address this issue, more data needs to be collected from these countries, but the cost of annotation can be a significant bottleneck. In this paper, we propose methods to identify the data to be annotated to balance model performance and annotation costs. Our approach first involves finding the countries with images of topics (objects and actions) most visually distinct from those already in the training datasets used by current large vision-language foundation models. Next, we identify countries with higher visual similarity for these topics and show that using data from these countries to supplement the training data improves model performance and reduces annotation costs. The resulting lists of countries and corresponding topics are made available at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/visual_diversity_budget.","sentences":["Current foundation models have shown impressive performance across various tasks.","However, several studies have revealed that these models are not effective for everyone due to the imbalanced geographical and economic representation of the data used in the training process.","Most of this data comes from Western countries, leading to poor results for underrepresented countries.","To address this issue, more data needs to be collected from these countries, but the cost of annotation can be a significant bottleneck.","In this paper, we propose methods to identify the data to be annotated to balance model performance and annotation costs.","Our approach first involves finding the countries with images of topics (objects and actions) most visually distinct from those already in the training datasets used by current large vision-language foundation models.","Next, we identify countries with higher visual similarity for these topics and show that using data from these countries to supplement the training data improves model performance and reduces annotation costs.","The resulting lists of countries and corresponding topics are made available at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/visual_diversity_budget."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07687v1"}

In the last decade, convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have yielded outstanding results in single-weather video removal. However, due to the absence of appropriate adaptation, most of them fail to generalize to other weather conditions. Although ViWS-Net is proposed to remove adverse weather conditions in videos with a single set of pre-trained weights, it is seriously blinded by seen weather at train-time and degenerates when coming to unseen weather during test-time. In this work, we introduce test-time adaptation into adverse weather removal in videos, and propose the first framework that integrates test-time adaptation into the iterative diffusion reverse process. Specifically, we devise a diffusion-based network with a novel temporal noise model to efficiently explore frame-correlated information in degraded video clips at training stage. During inference stage, we introduce a proxy task named Diffusion Tubelet Self-Calibration to learn the primer distribution of test video stream and optimize the model by approximating the temporal noise model for online adaptation. Experimental results, on benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our Test-Time Adaptation method with Diffusion-based network(Diff-TTA) outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring videos degraded by seen weather conditions. Its generalizable capability is also validated with unseen weather conditions in both synthesized and real-world videos.","sentences":["Real-world vision tasks frequently suffer from the appearance of unexpected adverse weather conditions, including rain, haze, snow, and raindrops.","In the last decade, convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have yielded outstanding results in single-weather video removal.","However, due to the absence of appropriate adaptation, most of them fail to generalize to other weather conditions.","Although ViWS-Net is proposed to remove adverse weather conditions in videos with a single set of pre-trained weights, it is seriously blinded by seen weather at train-time and degenerates when coming to unseen weather during test-time.","In this work, we introduce test-time adaptation into adverse weather removal in videos, and propose the first framework that integrates test-time adaptation into the iterative diffusion reverse process.","Specifically, we devise a diffusion-based network with a novel temporal noise model to efficiently explore frame-correlated information in degraded video clips at training stage.","During inference stage, we introduce a proxy task named Diffusion Tubelet Self-Calibration to learn the primer distribution of test video stream and optimize the model by approximating the temporal noise model for online adaptation.","Experimental results, on benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our Test-Time Adaptation method with Diffusion-based network(Diff-TTA) outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring videos degraded by seen weather conditions.","Its generalizable capability is also validated with unseen weather conditions in both synthesized and real-world videos."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07684v1"}

{"created":"2024-03-12 14:12:59","title":"MoralBERT: Detecting Moral Values in Social Discourse","abstract":"Morality plays a fundamental role in how we perceive information while greatly influencing our decisions and judgements. Controversial topics, including vaccination, abortion, racism, and sexuality, often elicit opinions and attitudes that are not solely based on evidence but rather reflect moral worldviews. Recent advances in natural language processing have demonstrated that moral values can be gauged in human-generated textual content. Here, we design a range of language representation models fine-tuned to capture exactly the moral nuances in text, called MoralBERT. We leverage annotated moral data from three distinct sources: Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook user-generated content covering various socially relevant topics. This approach broadens linguistic diversity and potentially enhances the models' ability to comprehend morality in various contexts. We also explore a domain adaptation technique and compare it to the standard fine-tuned BERT model, using two different frameworks for moral prediction: single-label and multi-label. We compare in-domain approaches with conventional models relying on lexicon-based techniques, as well as a Machine Learning classifier with Word2Vec representation. Our results showed that in-domain prediction models significantly outperformed traditional models. While the single-label setting reaches a higher accuracy than previously achieved for the task when using BERT pretrained models. Experiments in an out-of-domain setting, instead, suggest that further work is needed for existing domain adaptation techniques to generalise between different social media platforms, especially for the multi-label task. The investigations and outcomes from this study pave the way for further exploration, enabling a more profound comprehension of moral narratives about controversial social issues.","sentences":["Morality plays a fundamental role in how we perceive information while greatly influencing our decisions and judgements.","Controversial topics, including vaccination, abortion, racism, and sexuality, often elicit opinions and attitudes that are not solely based on evidence but rather reflect moral worldviews.","Recent advances in natural language processing have demonstrated that moral values can be gauged in human-generated textual content.","Here, we design a range of language representation models fine-tuned to capture exactly the moral nuances in text, called MoralBERT.","We leverage annotated moral data from three distinct sources: Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook user-generated content covering various socially relevant topics.","This approach broadens linguistic diversity and potentially enhances the models' ability to comprehend morality in various contexts.","We also explore a domain adaptation technique and compare it to the standard fine-tuned BERT model, using two different frameworks for moral prediction: single-label and multi-label.","We compare in-domain approaches with conventional models relying on lexicon-based techniques, as well as a Machine Learning classifier with Word2Vec representation.","Our results showed that in-domain prediction models significantly outperformed traditional models.","While the single-label setting reaches a higher accuracy than previously achieved for the task when using BERT pretrained models.","Experiments in an out-of-domain setting, instead, suggest that further work is needed for existing domain adaptation techniques to generalise between different social media platforms, especially for the multi-label task.","The investigations and outcomes from this study pave the way for further exploration, enabling a more profound comprehension of moral narratives about controversial social issues."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07678v1"}

SpatialNet exploits spatial information, such as the spatial/steering direction of speech, for discriminating between target speech and interferences, and achieved outstanding performance. The core of SpatialNet is a narrow-band self-attention module used for learning the temporal dynamic of spatial vectors. Towards long-term streaming speech enhancement, we propose to replace the offline self-attention network with online networks that have linear inference complexity w.r.t signal length and meanwhile maintain the capability of learning long-term information. Three variants are developed based on (i) masked self-attention, (ii) Retention, a self-attention variant with linear inference complexity, and (iii) Mamba, a structured-state-space-based RNN-like network. Moreover, we investigate the length extrapolation ability of different networks, namely test on signals that are much longer than training signals, and propose a short-signal training plus long-signal fine-tuning strategy, which largely improves the length extrapolation ability of the networks within limited training time. Overall, the proposed online SpatialNet achieves outstanding speech enhancement performance for long audio streams, and for both static and moving speakers.

{"created":"2024-03-12 14:06:44","title":"Towards Model Extraction Attacks in GAN-Based Image Translation via Domain Shift Mitigation","abstract":"Model extraction attacks (MEAs) enable an attacker to replicate the functionality of a victim deep neural network (DNN) model by only querying its API service remotely, posing a severe threat to the security and integrity of pay-per-query DNN-based services. Although the majority of current research on MEAs has primarily concentrated on neural classifiers, there is a growing prevalence of image-to-image translation (I2IT) tasks in our everyday activities. However, techniques developed for MEA of DNN classifiers cannot be directly transferred to the case of I2IT, rendering the vulnerability of I2IT models to MEA attacks often underestimated. This paper unveils the threat of MEA in I2IT tasks from a new perspective. Diverging from the traditional approach of bridging the distribution gap between attacker queries and victim training samples, we opt to mitigate the effect caused by the different distributions, known as the domain shift. This is achieved by introducing a new regularization term that penalizes high-frequency noise, and seeking a flatter minimum to avoid overfitting to the shifted distribution. Extensive experiments on different image translation tasks, including image super-resolution and style transfer, are performed on different backbone victim models, and the new design consistently outperforms the baseline by a large margin across all metrics. A few real-life I2IT APIs are also verified to be extremely vulnerable to our attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced defenses and potentially revised API publishing policies.","sentences":["Model extraction attacks (MEAs) enable an attacker to replicate the functionality of a victim deep neural network (DNN) model by only querying its API service remotely, posing a severe threat to the security and integrity of pay-per-query DNN-based services.","Although the majority of current research on MEAs has primarily concentrated on neural classifiers, there is a growing prevalence of image-to-image translation (I2IT) tasks in our everyday activities.","However, techniques developed for MEA of DNN classifiers cannot be directly transferred to the case of I2IT, rendering the vulnerability of I2IT models to MEA attacks often underestimated.","This paper unveils the threat of MEA in I2IT tasks from a new perspective.","Diverging from the traditional approach of bridging the distribution gap between attacker queries and victim training samples, we opt to mitigate the effect caused by the different distributions, known as the domain shift.","This is achieved by introducing a new regularization term that penalizes high-frequency noise, and seeking a flatter minimum to avoid overfitting to the shifted distribution.","Extensive experiments on different image translation tasks, including image super-resolution and style transfer, are performed on different backbone victim models, and the new design consistently outperforms the baseline by a large margin across all metrics.","A few real-life I2IT APIs are also verified to be extremely vulnerable to our attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced defenses and potentially revised API publishing policies."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07673v1"}
