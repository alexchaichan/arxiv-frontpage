                  <p>For a complete comprehension of multi-person scenes, it is essential to go beyond basic tasks like detection and tracking.Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial.Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks.To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data.The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable and data efficient representations of motion in human crowded scenes.Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints' trajectory in the frequency domain.After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks.Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists.Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views.Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold.First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back).Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered.This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator.In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts.We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent mastering of human language, but still struggle in real-world applications that require mathematical problem-solving.While many strategies and datasets to enhance LLMs' mathematics are developed, it remains a challenge to simultaneously maintain and improve both language and mathematical capabilities in deployed LLM systems.In this work, we tailor the Self-Critique pipeline, which addresses the challenge in the feedback learning stage of LLM alignment.We first train a general Math-Critique model from the LLM itself to provide feedback signals.Then, we sequentially employ rejective fine-tuning and direct preference optimization over the LLM's own generations for data collection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on ChatGLM3-32B, we conduct a series of experiments on both academic and our newly created challenging dataset, MathUserEval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Results show that our pipeline significantly enhances the LLM's mathematical problem-solving while still improving its language ability, outperforming LLMs that could be two times larger.Related techniques have been deployed to ChatGLM\footnote{\url{https://chatglm.cn}}, an online serving LLM.Related evaluation dataset and scripts are released at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-Math}.</p>

                  <p>Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years.Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training.These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations.Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art.Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training.In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn.None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time.This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images.It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image.To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery.Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations.Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset will be available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIS25k . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.943</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks.In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks.However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ).Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training.Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively.However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes.This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes.Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks.With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes.The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture.We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question.This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers.However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question.As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization.In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation.RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information.To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking.Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes to correct the rolling shutter(RS) distorted images by estimating the distortion flow from the global shutter (GS) to RS directly.Existing methods usually perform correction using the undistortion flow from the RS to GS.They initially predict the flow from consecutive RS frames, subsequently rescaling it as the displacement fields from the RS frame to the underlying GS image using time-dependent scaling factors.Following this, RS-aware forward warping is employed to convert the RS image into its GS counterpart.Nevertheless, this strategy is prone to two shortcomings.First, the undistortion flow estimation is rendered inaccurate by merely linear scaling the flow, due to the complex non-linear motion nature.Second, RS-aware forward warping often results in unavoidable artifacts.To address these limitations, we introduce a new framework that directly estimates the distortion flow and rectifies the RS image with the backward warping operation.More specifically, we first propose a global correlation-based flow attention mechanism to estimate the initial distortion flow and GS feature jointly, which are then refined by the following coarse-to-fine decoder layers.Additionally, a multi-distortion flow prediction strategy is integrated to mitigate the issue of inaccurate flow estimation further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>The project is available at \url{https://github.com/ljzycmd/DFRSC}.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications.To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted.However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak.Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically.These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful.However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations.(1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses.(2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not.   In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>Predicting future events always comes with uncertainty, but traditional non-Bayesian methods cannot distinguish certain from uncertain predictions or explain the confidence in their predictions.In survival analysis, Bayesian methods applied to state-of-the-art solutions in the healthcare and biomedical field are still novel, and their implications have not been fully evaluated.In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in deep neural networks for survival analysis with a focus on prediction and calibration performance.For this, we present a Bayesian deep learning framework that consists of three Bayesian network architectures, which we train by optimizing the Cox partial likelihood and combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty with model-specific epistemic uncertainty.This enables us to provide uncertainty estimates as credible intervals when predicting the survival curve or as a probability density function over the predicted median survival times.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For our empirical analyses, we evaluated our proposed method on four benchmark datasets and found that our method demonstrates prediction performance comparable to the state-of-the-art based on the concordance index and outperforms all other Cox-based approaches in terms of the mean absolute error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work explicitly compares the extent to which different Bayesian approximation techniques differ from each other and improves the prediction over traditional non-Bayesian alternatives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA.However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved.Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content.Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions.Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic.In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering.To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance.Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English.Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens.In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities.Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens).Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs.We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing.These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding.To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference.After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of 3D acquisition technology has made it possible to obtain point clouds of real-world terrains.However, due to limitations in sensor acquisition technology or specific requirements, point clouds often contain defects such as holes with missing data.Inpainting algorithms are widely used to patch these holes.However, existing traditional inpainting algorithms rely on precise hole boundaries, which limits their ability to handle cases where the boundaries are not well-defined.On the other hand, learning-based completion methods often prioritize reconstructing the entire point cloud instead of solely focusing on hole filling.Based on the fact that real-world terrain exhibits both global smoothness and rich local detail, we propose a novel representation for terrain point clouds.This representation can help to repair the holes without clear boundaries.Specifically, it decomposes terrains into low-frequency and high-frequency components, which are represented by B-spline surfaces and relative height maps respectively.In this way, the terrain point cloud inpainting problem is transformed into a B-spline surface fitting and 2D image inpainting problem.By solving the two problems, the highly complex and irregular holes on the terrain point clouds can be well-filled, which not only satisfies the global terrain undulation but also exhibits rich geometric details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human body restoration plays a vital role in various applications related to the human body.Despite recent advances in general image restoration using generative models, their performance in human body restoration remains mediocre, often resulting in foreground and background blending, over-smoothing surface textures, missing accessories, and distorted limbs.Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel approach by constructing a human body-aware diffusion model that leverages domain-specific knowledge to enhance performance.Specifically, we employ a pretrained body attention module to guide the diffusion model's focus on the foreground, addressing issues caused by blending between the subject and background.We also demonstrate the value of revisiting the language modality of the diffusion model in restoration tasks by seamlessly incorporating text prompt to improve the quality of surface texture and additional clothing and accessories details.Additionally, we introduce a diffusion sampler tailored for fine-grained human body parts, utilizing local semantic information to rectify limb distortions.Lastly, we collect a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking and advancing the field of human body restoration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental validation showcases the superiority of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, over existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models are transformative in sequential recommender systems, leveraging powerful representation learning capabilities.While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed.Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation.   IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT.More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks.Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT.This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training.   Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that "parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We release our codes and other materials at https://github.com/jjGenAILab/IISAN.</p>

In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines.Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics.We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/</p>

                  <p>Tokenisation is a core part of language models (LMs).It involves splitting a character sequence into subwords which are assigned arbitrary indices before being served to the LM.While typically lossless, however, this process may lead to less sample efficient LM training: as it removes character-level information, it could make it harder for LMs to generalise across similar subwords, such as now and Now.We refer to such subwords as near duplicates.In this paper, we study the impact of near duplicate subwords on LM training efficiency.First, we design an experiment that gives us an upper bound to how much we should expect a model to improve if we could perfectly generalise across near duplicates.We do this by duplicating each subword in our LM's vocabulary, creating perfectly equivalent classes of subwords.Experimentally, we find that LMs need roughly 17% more data when trained in a fully duplicated setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we investigate the impact of naturally occurring near duplicates on LMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we see that merging them considerably hurts LM performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Therefore, although subword duplication negatively impacts LM training efficiency, naturally occurring near duplicates may not be as similar as anticipated, limiting the potential for performance improvements.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>
