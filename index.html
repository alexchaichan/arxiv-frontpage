                  <p>Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario.However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy.To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance.Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data.TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients.Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training.Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>We propose VLOGGER, a method for audio-driven human video generation from a single input image of a person, which builds on the success of recent generative diffusion models.Our method consists of 1) a stochastic human-to-3d-motion diffusion model, and 2) a novel diffusion-based architecture that augments text-to-image models with both spatial and temporal controls.This supports the generation of high quality video of variable length, easily controllable through high-level representations of human faces and bodies.In contrast to previous work, our method does not require training for each person, does not rely on face detection and cropping, generates the complete image (not just the face or the lips), and considers a broad spectrum of scenarios (e.g. visible torso or diverse subject identities) that are critical to correctly synthesize humans who communicate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate MENTOR, a new and diverse dataset with 3d pose and expression annotations, one order of magnitude larger than previous ones (800,000 identities) and with dynamic gestures, on which we train and ablate our main technical contributions.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>VLOGGER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three public benchmarks, considering image quality, identity preservation and temporal consistency while also generating upper-body gestures.We analyze the performance of VLOGGER with respect to multiple diversity metrics, showing that our architectural choices and the use of MENTOR benefit training a fair and unbiased model at scale.Finally we show applications in video editing and personalization.</p>

                  <p>High-performing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, both anomaly and novel class, is an important prerequisite for the practical use of classification models.In this paper, we focus on the species recognition task in images concerned with large databases, a large number of fine-grained hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, and varying image quality.We propose a framework for combining individual OOD measures into one combined OOD (COOD) measure using a supervised model.The individual measures are several existing state-of-the-art measures and several novel OOD measures developed with novel class detection and hierarchical class structure in mind.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>COOD was extensively evaluated on three large-scale (500k+ images) biodiversity datasets in the context of anomaly and novel class detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>We show that COOD outperforms individual, including state-of-the-art, OOD measures by a large margin in terms of TPR@1% FPR in the majority of experiments, e.g., improving detecting ImageNet images (OOD) from 54.3% to 85.4% for the iNaturalist 2018 dataset.SHAP (feature contribution) analysis shows that different individual OOD measures are essential for various tasks, indicating that multiple OOD measures and combinations are needed to generalize.Additionally, we show that explicitly considering ID images that are incorrectly classified for the original (species) recognition task is important for constructing high-performing OOD detection methods and for practical applicability.The framework can easily be extended or adapted to other tasks and media modalities.</p>

                  <p>Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment.In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations.The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions.Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background.However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task.Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes.We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models.This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing demand for automatic high-level image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) within images, underscores the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches.These approaches need to harmonize traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced, context-dependent knowledge humans employ to interpret images at intricate semantic levels.In this work, we leverage situated perceptual knowledge of cultural images to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification.We automatically extract perceptual semantic units from images, which we then model and integrate into the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This resource captures situated perceptual semantics gleaned from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Additionally, we enhance the AKG with high-level linguistic frames.We compute KG embeddings and experiment with relative representations and hybrid approaches that fuse these embeddings with visual transformer embeddings.Finally, for interpretability, we conduct posthoc qualitative analyses by examining model similarities with training instances.Our results show that our hybrid KGE-ViT methods outperform existing techniques in AC image classification.The posthoc interpretability analyses reveal the visual transformer's proficiency in capturing pixel-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing more abstract and semantic scene elements.We demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding for AC image classification.This work suggests a strong potential of neuro-symbolic methods for knowledge integration and robust image representation for use in downstream intricate visual comprehension tasks.All the materials and code are available online.</p>

                  <p>Understanding a surgical scene is crucial for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide any intelligent assistance functionality.One way of achieving this scene understanding is via scene segmentation, where every pixel of a frame is classified and therefore identifies the visible structures and tissues.Progress on fully segmenting surgical scenes has been made using machine learning.However, such models require large amounts of annotated training data, containing examples of all relevant object classes.Such fully annotated datasets are hard to create, as every pixel in a frame needs to be annotated by medical experts and, therefore, are rarely available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a method to combine multiple partially annotated datasets, which provide complementary annotations, into one model, enabling better scene segmentation and the use of multiple readily available datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Our method aims to combine available data with complementary labels by leveraging mutual exclusive properties to maximize information.Specifically, we propose to use positive annotations of other classes as negative samples and to exclude background pixels of binary annotations, as we cannot tell if they contain a class not annotated but predicted by the model.We evaluate our method by training a DeepLabV3 on the publicly available Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary segmented anatomical structures.Our approach successfully combines 6 classes into one model, increasing the overall Dice Score by 4.4% compared to an ensemble of models trained on the classes individually.By including information on multiple classes, we were able to reduce confusion between stomach and colon by 24%.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training a model on multiple datasets.This paves the way for future work further alleviating the need for one large, fully segmented datasets.</p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns.Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise.OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes.They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem.Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning.In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions.The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise.The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss.To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the domain of text-guided image generation and, more recently, in text-guided image editing.A commonly adopted strategy for editing real images involves inverting the diffusion process to obtain a noisy representation of the original image, which is then denoised to achieve the desired edits.However, current methods for diffusion inversion often struggle to produce edits that are both faithful to the specified text prompt and closely resemble the source image.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and adaptable diffusion inversion technique for real image editing, which is grounded in a theoretical analysis of the role of $\eta$ in the DDIM sampling equation for enhanced editability.By designing a universal diffusion inversion method with a time- and region-dependent $\eta$ function, we enable flexible control over the editing extent.Through a comprehensive series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, involving a comparison with a broad array of recent methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method not only sets a new benchmark in the field but also significantly outperforms existing strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/eta-inversion</p>

                  <p>Piecewise Polynomials (PPs) are utilized in several engineering disciplines, like trajectory planning, to approximate position profiles given in the form of a set of points.While the approximation target along with domain-specific requirements, like Ck -continuity, can be formulated as a system of equations and a result can be computed directly, such closed-form solutions posses limited flexibility with respect to polynomial degrees, polynomial bases or adding further domain-specific requirements.Sufficiently complex optimization goals soon call for the use of numerical methods, like gradient descent.Since gradient descent lies at the heart of training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), modern Machine Learning (ML) frameworks like TensorFlow come with a set of gradient-based optimizers potentially suitable for a wide range of optimization problems beyond the training task for ANNs.Our approach is to utilize the versatility of PP models and combine it with the potential of modern ML optimizers for the use in function approximation in 1D trajectory planning in the context of electronic cam design.We utilize available optimizers of the ML framework TensorFlow directly, outside of the scope of ANNs, to optimize model parameters of our PP model.In this paper, we show how an orthogonal polynomial basis contributes to improving approximation and continuity optimization performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, we develop a novel regularization approach enabling clearly improved convergence behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>We show that, using this regularization approach, Chebyshev basis performs better than power basis for all relevant optimizers in the combined approximation and continuity optimization setting and demonstrate usability of the presented approach within the electronic cam domain.</p>

Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.   It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.   This is achieved by the two terms:   (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.

The shared task was tackled by a total of 58 different users grouped in 42 teams, out of which 27 elected to write a system description paper; collectively, they submitted over 300 prediction sets on both tracks of the shared task.We observe a number of key trends in how this approach was tackled -- many participants rely on a handful of model, and often rely either on synthetic data for fine-tuning or zero-shot prompting strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While a majority of the teams did outperform our proposed baseline system, the performances of top-scoring systems are still consistent with a random handling of the more challenging items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels.Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability.To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information.In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain.Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task.Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time.To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment.To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: Static analyses are well-established to aid in understanding bugs or vulnerabilities during the development process or in large-scale studies.A low false-positive rate is essential for the adaption in practice and for precise results of empirical studies.Unfortunately, static analyses tend to report where a vulnerability manifests rather than the fix location.This can cause presumed false positives or imprecise results.Method: To address this problem, we designed an adaption of an existing static analysis algorithm that can distinguish between a manifestation and fix location, and reports error chains.An error chain represents at least two interconnected errors that occur successively, thus building the connection between the fix and manifestation location.We used our tool CogniCryptSUBS for a case study on 471 GitHub repositories, a performance benchmark to compare different analysis configurations, and conducted an expert interview.Result:We found that 50 % of the projects with a report had at least one error chain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our runtime benchmark demonstrated that our improvement caused only a minimal runtime overhead of less than 4 %. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>The results of our expert interview indicate that with our adapted version participants require fewer executions of the analysis.Conclusion: Our results indicate that error chains occur frequently in real-world projects, and ignoring them can lead to imprecise evaluation results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The runtime benchmark indicates that our tool is a feasible and efficient solution for detecting error chains in real-world projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, our results gave a hint that the usability of static analyses may benefit from supporting error chains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>For users requesting popular contents from content providers, edge caching can alleviate backhaul pressure and enhance the quality of experience of users.Recently there is also a growing concern about content freshness that is quantified by age of information (AoI).Therefore, AoI-aware online caching algorithms are required, which is challenging because the content popularity is usually unknown in advance and may vary over time.In this paper, we propose an online digital twin (DT) empowered content resale mechanism in AoI-aware edge caching networks.We aim to design an optimal two-timescale caching strategy to maximize the utility of an edge network service provider (ENSP).The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and NP-hard.To tackle this intractable problem, we propose a DT-assisted Online Caching Algorithm (DT-OCA).In specific, we first decompose our formulated problem into a series of subproblems, each handling a cache period.For each cache period, we use a DT-based prediction method to effectively capture future content popularity, and develop online caching strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Competitive ratio analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has promising performance, and outperforms other benchmark algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Insightful observations are also found and discussed.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical.While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge.Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence.   Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in remote heart rate measurement, motivated by data-driven approaches, have notably enhanced accuracy.However, these improvements primarily focus on recovering the rPPG signal, overlooking the implicit challenges of estimating the heart rate (HR) from the derived signal.While many methods employ the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for HR estimation, the performance of the FFT is inherently affected by a limited frequency resolution.In contrast, the Chirp-Z Transform (CZT), a generalization form of FFT, can refine the spectrum to the narrow-band range of interest for heart rate, providing improved frequential resolution and, consequently, more accurate estimation.This paper presents the advantages of employing the CZT for remote HR estimation and introduces a novel data-driven adaptive CZT estimator.The objective of our proposed model is to tailor the CZT to match the characteristics of each specific dataset sensor, facilitating a more optimal and accurate estimation of HR from the rPPG signal without compromising generalization across diverse datasets.This is achieved through a Sparse Matrix Optimization (SMO).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of our model through exhaustive evaluations on three publicly available datasets UCLA-rPPG, PURE, and UBFC-rPPG employing both intra- and cross-database performance metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The results reveal outstanding heart rate estimation capabilities, establishing the proposed approach as a robust and versatile estimator for any rPPG method.</p>

                  <p>Learning to defer (L2D) aims to improve human-AI collaboration systems by learning how to defer decisions to humans when they are more likely to be correct than an ML classifier.Existing research in L2D overlooks key aspects of real-world systems that impede its practical adoption, namely: i) neglecting cost-sensitive scenarios, where type 1 and type 2 errors have different costs; ii) requiring concurrent human predictions for every instance of the training dataset and iii) not dealing with human work capacity constraints.To address these issues, we propose the deferral under cost and capacity constraints framework (DeCCaF).DeCCaF is a novel L2D approach, employing supervised learning to model the probability of human error under less restrictive data requirements (only one expert prediction per instance) and using constraint programming to globally minimize the error cost subject to workload limitations.We test DeCCaF in a series of cost-sensitive fraud detection scenarios with different teams of 9 synthetic fraud analysts, with individual work capacity constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than the baselines in a wide array of scenarios, achieving an average 8.4% reduction in the misclassification cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:Advances in deep learning have resulted in effective models for surgical video analysis; however, these models often fail to generalize across medical centers due to domain shift caused by variations in surgical workflow, camera setups, and patient demographics.Recently, object-centric learning has emerged as a promising approach for improved surgical scene understanding, capturing and disentangling visual and semantic properties of surgical tools and anatomy to improve downstream task performance.In this work, we conduct a multi-centric performance benchmark of object-centric approaches, focusing on Critical View of Safety assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, then propose an improved approach for unseen domain generalization.   Methods: We evaluate four object-centric approaches for domain generalization, establishing baseline performance.Next, leveraging the disentangled nature of object-centric representations, we dissect one of these methods through a series of ablations (e.g. ignoring either visual or semantic features for downstream classification).Finally, based on the results of these ablations, we develop an optimized method specifically tailored for domain generalization, LG-DG, that includes a novel disentanglement loss function.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: Our optimized approach, LG-DG, achieves an improvement of 9.28% over the best baseline approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>More broadly, we show that object-centric approaches are highly effective for domain generalization thanks to their modular approach to representation learning.   Conclusion: We investigate the use of object-centric methods for unseen domain generalization, identify method-agnostic factors critical for performance, and present an optimized approach that substantially outperforms existing methods.</p>

                  <p>When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think.Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text.For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation.In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer.This is a highly constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text.We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions.We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens.To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique.Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions.In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%$\rightarrow$10.9%) and CommonsenseQA(36.3%$\rightarrow$47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text.Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>
