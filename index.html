                  <p>Thoroughly testing autonomy systems is crucial in the pursuit of safe autonomous driving vehicles.It necessitates creating safety-critical scenarios that go beyond what can be safely collected from real-world data, as many of these scenarios occur infrequently on public roads.However, the evaluation of most existing NVS methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground truth images using metrics.Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations.Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world.To address this, this paper presents a novel driving view synthesis dataset and benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is unique as it includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by 1-4 meters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It comprises six sequences encompassing various time and weather conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each sequence contains 450 training images, 150 testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span>Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multi-camera settings.The experimental findings underscore the significant gap that exists in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is released publicly at the project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce WildTeaming, an automatic LLM safety red-teaming framework that mines in-the-wild user-chatbot interactions to discover 5.7K unique clusters of novel jailbreak tactics, and then composes multiple tactics for systematic exploration of novel jailbreaks.Compared to prior work that performed red-teaming via recruited human workers, gradient-based optimization, or iterative revision with LLMs, our work investigates jailbreaks from chatbot users who were not specifically instructed to break the system.WildTeaming reveals previously unidentified vulnerabilities of frontier LLMs, resulting in up to 4.6x more diverse and successful adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art jailbreak methods.   While many datasets exist for jailbreak evaluation, very few open-source datasets exist for jailbreak training, as safety training data has been closed even when model weights are open.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With WildTeaming we create WildJailbreak, a large-scale open-source synthetic safety dataset with 262K vanilla (direct request) and adversarial (complex jailbreak) prompt-response pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span>To mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors, WildJailbreak provides two contrastive types of queries: 1) harmful queries (vanilla & adversarial) and 2) benign queries that resemble harmful queries in form but contain no harm.As WildJailbreak considerably upgrades the quality and scale of existing safety resources, it uniquely enables us to examine the scaling effects of data and the interplay of data properties and model capabilities during safety training.Through extensive experiments, we identify the training properties that enable an ideal balance of safety behaviors: appropriate safeguarding without over-refusal, effective handling of vanilla and adversarial queries, and minimal, if any, decrease in general capabilities.All components of WildJailbeak contribute to achieving balanced safety behaviors of models.</p>

                  <p>Chart understanding plays a pivotal role when applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to real-world tasks such as analyzing scientific papers or financial reports.However, existing datasets often focus on oversimplified and homogeneous charts with template-based questions, leading to an over-optimistic measure of progress.We demonstrate that although open-source models can appear to outperform strong proprietary models on these benchmarks, a simple stress test with slightly different charts or questions can deteriorate performance by up to 34.5%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose CharXiv, a comprehensive evaluation suite involving 2,323 natural, challenging, and diverse charts from arXiv papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>CharXiv includes two types of questions: 1) descriptive questions about examining basic chart elements and 2) reasoning questions that require synthesizing information across complex visual elements in the chart.To ensure quality, all charts and questions are handpicked, curated, and verified by human experts.Our results reveal a substantial, previously underestimated gap between the reasoning skills of the strongest proprietary model (i.e., GPT-4o), which achieves 47.1% accuracy, and the strongest open-source model (i.e., InternVL Chat V1.5), which achieves 29.2%.All models lag far behind human performance of 80.5%, underscoring weaknesses in the chart understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs.We hope CharXiv facilitates future research on MLLM chart understanding by providing a more realistic and faithful measure of progress.Project page and leaderboard: https://charxiv.github.io/</p>

                  <p>We propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation benchmark, ChronoMagic-Bench, to evaluate the temporal and metamorphic capabilities of the T2V models (e.g. Sora and Lumiere) in time-lapse video generation.In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on the visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence.The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query.For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories.This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations.To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence.MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity.Based on the ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce MultiDiff, a novel approach for consistent novel view synthesis of scenes from a single RGB image.The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature, as there exist multiple, plausible explanations for unobserved areas.To address this issue, we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models.Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views, increasing geometric stability.The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes, allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images.In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation, MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements, while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude.For additional consistency and image quality improvements, we introduce a novel, structured noise distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate that MultiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging, real-world datasets RealEstate10K and ScanNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Finally, our model naturally supports multi-view consistent editing without the need for further tuning.</p>

                  <p>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many.One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature.Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature.However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence.We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases.We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102).Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84.We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews.Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The instruction-following ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has cultivated a class of LLM-based systems capable of approaching complex tasks such as making edits to large code repositories.Due to the high sensitivity and unpredictability of LLM behavior in response to changes in prompting, robust evaluation tools are needed to drive future iteration of these systems.We propose RES-Q, a natural language instruction-based benchmark for evaluating $\textbf{R}$epository $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{S}$ystems, which consists of 100 repository editing tasks derived from real GitHub commits.Given an edit instruction and a code repository, RES-Q evaluates an LLM system's ability to gather information and construct an edit that satisfies the criteria set by the instruction.We argue that evaluating LLMs in this way addresses issues with traditional benchmarks and provides a more holistic assessment of a model's abilities.We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs as language agents in a repository-editing system built on Qurrent OS, our language agent development software.Despite their 1% pass@1 performance difference on HumanEval, we find Claude Sonnet 3.5 outperforms GPT-4o by 12% pass@1 on RES-Q, indicating RES-Q's capacity to differentiate model capability as traditional benchmarks approach saturation.We further investigate token efficiency, performance relationships with existing benchmarks, and interesting disparities between closed and open-source LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Qurrent-AI/RES-Q. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying user's opinions and stances in long conversation threads on various topics can be extremely critical for enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, conflict resolution, targeted advertising, and content moderation.Hence, training language models to automate this task is critical.However, to train such models, gathering manual annotations has multiple challenges: 1) It is time-consuming and costly; 2) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing chances of noisy annotations; and 3) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly.Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we leverage Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the human annotation process on the following two tasks while also providing reasoning: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance of a post in a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which deals with labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale.The majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from these two LLMs on 764 multi-user Reddit conversations helps us curate the USDC dataset.USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models for the 5-class stance and 4-class dogmatism classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/USDC-0F7F]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection.Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise.However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries.Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored.To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode.Specifically, we construct the first malware summaries, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort.At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS dataset and a benign pseudocode dataset.Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary.Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting the usability, accuracy, and completeness of summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT.Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger ChatGPT3.5.</p>

                  <p>The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution.We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses.First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment.Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation.Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response.Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models?Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning.A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other.Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis.They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/thomlake/investigating-alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show amazing performance on many domain-specific tasks after fine-tuning with some appropriate data.However, many domain-specific data are privately distributed across multiple owners.Thus, this dilemma raises the interest in how to perform LLM fine-tuning in federated learning (FL).However, confronted with limited computation and communication capacities, FL clients struggle to fine-tune an LLM effectively.To this end, we introduce FedBiOT, a resource-efficient LLM fine-tuning approach to FL.Specifically, our method involves the server generating a compressed LLM and aligning its performance with the full model.Subsequently, the clients fine-tune a lightweight yet important part of the compressed model, referred to as an adapter.Notice that as the server has no access to the private data owned by the clients, the data used for alignment by the server has a different distribution from the one used for fine-tuning by clients.We formulate the problem into a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the negative effect of data discrepancy and derive the updating rules for the server and clients.We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-2, empirically showing that the adapter has exceptional performance when reintegrated into the global LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results also indicate that the proposed FedBiOT significantly reduces resource consumption compared to existing benchmarks, all while achieving comparable performance levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings.In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution.Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Ann. Probab. 1982] provided an upper bound on the worst-case approximation ratio that was later matched by an algorithm of Correa et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>[Math. Oper.Res. 2021].The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy.A similar result for $k>1$ has remained elusive.   In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality.To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</p>

                  <p>In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach.Effective HRL hinges on a suitable subgoal represen tation function, abstracting state space into latent subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors.Existing methods adopt a subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to latent subgoal space.Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the first probabilistic subgoal representation.Our method employs a GP prior on the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through learnable kernels.This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties.Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under diverse reward conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.</p>

                  <p>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket.Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket.Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types.While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity.Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address this, we propose BADGER:Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement.BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins.Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV).ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor.By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model.We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods.We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Long-context capabilities are essential for large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex and long-input tasks.Despite numerous efforts made to optimize LLMs for long contexts, challenges persist in robustly processing long inputs.In this paper, we introduce GraphReader, a graph-based agent system designed to handle long texts by structuring them into a graph and employing an agent to explore this graph autonomously.Upon receiving a question, the agent first undertakes a step-by-step analysis and devises a rational plan.It then invokes a set of predefined functions to read node content and neighbors, facilitating a coarse-to-fine exploration of the graph.Throughout the exploration, the agent continuously records new insights and reflects on current circumstances to optimize the process until it has gathered sufficient information to generate an answer.Experimental results on the LV-Eval dataset reveal that GraphReader, using a 4k context window, consistently outperforms GPT-4-128k across context lengths from 16k to 256k by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approach demonstrates superior performance on four challenging single-hop and multi-hop benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses.WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios.Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 26.4% improvement on refusal detection).Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 3.9% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8% to 2.4%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug localization refers to the identification of source code files which is in a programming language and also responsible for the unexpected behavior of software using the bug report, which is a natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As bug localization is labor-intensive, bug localization models are employed to assist software developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Due to the domain difference between source code files and bug reports, modern bug-localization systems, based on deep learning models, rely heavily on embedding techniques that project bug reports and source code files into a shared vector space.The creation of an embedding involves several design choices, but the impact of these choices on the quality of embedding and the performance of bug localization models remains unexplained in current research.   To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>

                  <p>Mitigating biases in generative AI and, particularly in text-to-image models, is of high importance given their growing implications in society.The biased datasets used for training pose challenges in ensuring the responsible development of these models, and mitigation through hard prompting or embedding alteration, are the most common present solutions.Our work introduces a novel approach to achieve diverse and inclusive synthetic images by learning a direction in the latent space and solely modifying the initial Gaussian noise provided for the diffusion process.Maintaining a neutral prompt and untouched embeddings, this approach successfully adapts to diverse debiasing scenarios, such as geographical biases.Moreover, our work proves it is possible to linearly combine these learned latent directions to introduce new mitigations, and if desired, integrate it with text embedding adjustments.Furthermore, text-to-image models lack transparency for assessing bias in outputs, unless visually inspected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, we provide a tool to empower developers to select their desired concepts to mitigate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>The project page with code is available online.</p>
