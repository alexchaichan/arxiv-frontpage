                  <p>Timeline algorithms are key parts of online social networks, but during recent years they have been blamed for increasing polarization and disagreement in our society.Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how these models can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms.We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics.Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data.We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others.We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n} \lg(1/\varepsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $n$ is the number of vertices.We also present an algorithm that provably computes an $\varepsilon$-approximation of our model in near-linear time.We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we release an anonymized graph dataset with ground-truth opinions and more than 27\,000 nodes (the previously largest publicly available dataset contains less than 550 nodes). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span></p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational context.Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships.However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic.This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities.The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le\'on, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020.The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data.The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures.The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection.The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection.The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network.Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>Food computing brings various perspectives to computer vision like vision-based food analysis for nutrition and health.As a fundamental task in food computing, food detection needs Zero-Shot Detection (ZSD) on novel unseen food objects to support real-world scenarios, such as intelligent kitchens and smart restaurants.Therefore, we first benchmark the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) by introducing FOWA dataset with rich attribute annotations.Unlike ZSD, fine-grained problems in ZSFD like inter-class similarity make synthesized features inseparable.The complexity of food semantic attributes further makes it more difficult for current ZSD methods to distinguish various food categories.To address these problems, we propose a novel framework ZSFDet to tackle fine-grained problems by exploiting the interaction between complex attributes.Specifically, we model the correlation between food categories and attributes in ZSFDet by multi-source graphs to provide prior knowledge for distinguishing fine-grained features.Within ZSFDet, Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) learns knowledge representation from multiple sources (e.g., ingredients correlation from knowledge graph) via the multi-source graph fusion.Conditioned on the fusion of semantic knowledge representation, the region feature diffusion model in KEFS can generate fine-grained features for training the effective zero-shot detector.Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method ZSFDet on FOWA and the widely-used food dataset UECFOOD-256, with significant improvements by 1.8% and 3.7% ZSD mAP compared with the strong baseline RRFS.Further experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO prove that enhancement of the semantic knowledge can also improve the performance on general ZSD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/KEFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes.Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts.This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images.Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models.Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics.The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice.The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of fake news has emerged as a severe societal problem, raising significant interest from industry and academia.While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs).To address this challenge, we propose {\methodname}, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models.This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above.The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms.Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we present comprehensive evaluation results on four datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and trustworthiness of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/less-and-less-bugs/Trust_TELLER}.</p>

                  <p>Language models are now capable of solving tasks that require dealing with long sequences consisting of hundreds of thousands of tokens.However, they often fail on tasks that require repetitive use of simple rules, even on sequences that are much shorter than those seen during training.For example, state-of-the-art LLMs can find common items in two lists with up to 20 items but fail when lists have 80 items.In this paper, we introduce Lissard, a benchmark comprising seven tasks whose goal is to assess the ability of models to process and generate wide-range sequence lengths, requiring repetitive procedural execution.Our evaluation of open-source (Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8x7B) and proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) show a consistent decline in performance across all models as the complexity of the sequence increases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code are available at https://github.com/unicamp-dl/Lissard <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span></p>

                  <p>Infographics are visual representations designed for efficient and effective communication of data and knowledge.One crucial aspect of infographic design is the interplay between text and visual elements, particularly in circular visualizations where the textual descriptions can either be embedded within the graphics or placed adjacent to the visual representation.While several studies have examined text layout design in visualizations in general, the text-visual interplay in infographics and its subsequent perceptual effects remain underexplored.To address this, our study investigates how varying text placement and descriptiveness impact pleasantness, comprehension and overall memorability in the infographics viewing experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recruited 30 participants and presented them with a collection of 15 infographics across a diverse set of topics, including media and public events, health and nutrition, science and research, and sustainability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The text placement (embed, side-to-side) and descriptiveness (simplistic, normal, descriptive) were systematically manipulated, resulting in a total of six experimental conditions.Our key findings indicate that text placement can significantly influence the memorability of infographics, whereas descriptiveness can significantly impact the pleasantness of the viewing experience.Embedding text placement and simplistic text can potentially contribute to more effective infographic designs.These results offer valuable insights for infographic designers, contributing to the creation of more effective and memorable visual representations.</p>

                  <p>The availability of a reliable map and a robust localization system is critical for the operation of an autonomous vehicle.In a modern system, both mapping and localization solutions generally employ convolutional neural network (CNN) --based perception.Hence, any algorithm should consider potential errors in perception for safe and robust functioning.In this work, we present uncertainty-aware panoptic Localization and Mapping (uPLAM), which employs perception uncertainty as a bridge to fuse the perception information with classical localization and mapping approaches.We introduce an uncertainty-based map aggregation technique to create a long-term panoptic bird's eye view map and provide an associated mapping uncertainty.Our map consists of surface semantics and landmarks with unique IDs.Moreover, we present panoptic uncertainty-aware particle filter-based localization.To this end, we propose an uncertainty-based particle importance weight calculation for the adaptive incorporation of perception information into localization.We also present a new dataset for evaluating long-term panoptic mapping and map-based localization.Extensive evaluations showcase that our proposed uncertainty incorporation leads to better mapping with reliable uncertainty estimates and accurate localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our dataset and code available at: \url{http://uplam.cs.uni-freiburg.de} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the context of rapid advancements in industrial automation, vision-based robotic grasping plays an increasingly crucial role.In order to enhance visual recognition accuracy, the utilization of large-scale datasets is imperative for training models to acquire implicit knowledge related to the handling of various objects.Creating datasets from scratch is a time and labor-intensive process.Moreover, existing datasets often contain errors due to automated annotations aimed at expediency, making the improvement of these datasets a substantial research challenge.Consequently, several issues have been identified in the annotation of grasp bounding boxes within the popular Jacquard Grasp.We propose utilizing a Human-In-The-Loop(HIL) method to enhance dataset quality.This approach relies on backbone deep learning networks to predict object positions and orientations for robotic grasping.Predictions with Intersection over Union (IOU) values below 0.2 undergo an assessment by human operators.After their evaluation, the data is categorized into False Negatives(FN) and True Negatives(TN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FN are then subcategorized into either missing annotations or catastrophic labeling errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Images lacking labels are augmented with valid grasp bounding box information, whereas images afflicted by catastrophic labeling errors are completely removed.The open-source tool Labelbee was employed for 53,026 iterations of HIL dataset enhancement, leading to the removal of 2,884 images and the incorporation of ground truth information for 30,292 images.The enhanced dataset, named the Jacquard V2 Grasping Dataset, served as the training data for a range of neural networks.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: We apply federated learning to train an OCT image classifier simulating a realistic scenario with multiple clients and statistical heterogeneous data distribution where data in the clients lack samples of some categories entirely.   Methods: We investigate the effectiveness of FedAvg and FedProx to train an OCT image classification model in a decentralized fashion, addressing privacy concerns associated with centralizing data.We partitioned a publicly available OCT dataset across multiple clients under IID and Non-IID settings and conducted local training on the subsets for each client.We evaluated two federated learning methods, FedAvg and FedProx for these settings.   Results: Our experiments on the dataset suggest that under IID settings, both methods perform on par with training on a central data pool.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the performance of both algorithms declines as we increase the statistical heterogeneity across the client data, while FedProx consistently performs better than FedAvg in the increased heterogeneity settings.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Conclusion: Despite the effectiveness of federated learning in the utilization of private data across multiple medical institutions, the large number of clients and heterogeneous distribution of labels deteriorate the performance of both algorithms.Notably, FedProx appears to be more robust to the increased heterogeneity.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been extensively employed to align large language models with user intent.However, proximal policy optimization (PPO) based RLHF is occasionally unstable requiring significant hyperparameter finetuning, and computationally expensive to maximize the estimated reward during alignment.Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges.However, DPO relies on contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM, instead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF.In this paper, we addresses both challenges by systematically combining rejection sampling (RS) and DPO.Our proposed method, RS-DPO, initiates with the development of a supervised fine-tuned policy model (SFT).A varied set of k responses per prompt are sampled directly from the SFT model.RS-DPO identifies pairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution.Finally, we apply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference.Our experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs with limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user intent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods, including RS, PPO, and DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Countries worldwide have been implementing different actions national strategies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to shape policy priorities and guide their development concerning AI.Several AI indices have emerged to assess countries' progress in AI development, aiding decision-making on investments and policy choices.Typically, these indices combine multiple indicators using linear additive methods such as weighted sums, although they are limited in their ability to account for interactions among indicators.Another limitation concerns the use of deterministic weights, which can be perceived as subjective and vulnerable to debate and scrutiny, especially by nations that feel disadvantaged.Aiming at mitigating these problems, we conduct a methodological analysis to derive AI indices based on multiple criteria decision analysis.Initially, we assess correlations between different AI dimensions and employ the Choquet integral to model them.Thus, we apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to conduct a sensitivity analysis using both weighted sum and Choquet integral in order to evaluate the stability of the indices with regard the weights.Finally, we introduce a novel ranking methodology based on SMAA, which considers several sets of weights to derive the ranking of countries.As a result, instead of using predefined weights, in the proposed approach, the ranking is achieved based on the probabilities of countries in occupying a specific position.In the computational analysis, we utilize the data employed in The Global AI Index proposed by Tortoise.Results reveal correlations in the data, and our approach effectively mitigates bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the sensitivity analysis, we scrutinize changes in the ranking resulting from weight adjustments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our proposal rankings closely align with those derived from weight variations, proving to be more robust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given a network, allocating resources at clusters level, rather than at each node, enhances efficiency in resource allocation and usage.In this paper, we study the problem of finding fully connected disjoint clusters to minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the number of nodes assigned to the clusters, while also ensuring that no two nodes within a cluster exceed a threshold distance.While the problem can easily be formulated using a binary linear model, traditional combinatorial optimization solvers struggle when dealing with large-scale instances.We propose an approach to solve this constrained clustering problem via reinforcement learning.Our method involves training an agent to generate both feasible and (near) optimal solutions.The agent learns problem-specific heuristics, tailored to the instances encountered in this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the results section, we show that our algorithm finds near optimal solutions, even for large scale instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Diffusion Models remains an underexplored frontier in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially when compared with the remarkable progress made in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data.Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images ("winner" and "loser" images) for each text prompt.In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process.Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment.Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on Human Preference Alignment (HPA) to ensure the generation of safe content.Due to the heavy cost associated with fine-tuning, fine-tuning-free methods have emerged, typically modifying LLM decoding with external auxiliary methods.However, these methods do not essentially enhance the LLM itself.In this paper, we rethink the derivation procedures of DPO, based on which we conversely build an instant scorer using the states of the LLM before and after In-context Learning (ICL).Accordingly, we propose a novel approach called In-Context Direct Preference Optimization (ICDPO).It enables LLMs to borrow the HPA capabilities from superior LLMs with ICL, generating well-aligned responses as estimated by the aforementioned instant scorer, thereby enhancing the final performance.ICDPO can be further enhanced with a two-stage retriever and an upgraded scorer, both offering benefits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show its effectiveness, particularly in outperforming two fine-tuning-free baselines, and it exhibits competitiveness with SFT + LoRA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into ICDPO.</p>

                  <p>Demonstrations are commonly used to speed up the learning process of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.To cope with the difficulty of accessing multiple demonstrations, some algorithms have been developed to learn from a single demonstration.In particular, the Divide & Conquer Imitation Learning algorithms leverage a sequential bias to learn a control policy for complex robotic tasks using a single state-based demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The latest version, DCIL-II demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>This novel method operates within an extended Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning framework, ensuring compatibility between intermediate and subsequent goals extracted from the demonstration.However, a fundamental limitation arises from the assumption that the system can be reset to specific states along the demonstrated trajectory, confining the application to simulated systems.In response, we introduce an extension called Single-Reset DCIL (SR-DCIL), designed to overcome this constraint by relying on a single initial state reset rather than sequential resets.To address this more challenging setting, we integrate two mechanisms inspired by the Learning from Demonstrations literature, including a Demo-Buffer and Value Cloning, to guide the agent toward compatible success states.In addition, we introduce Approximate Goal Switching to facilitate training to reach goals distant from the reset state.Our paper makes several contributions, highlighting the importance of the reset assumption in DCIL-II, presenting the mechanisms of SR-DCIL variants and evaluating their performance in challenging robotic tasks compared to DCIL-II.In summary, this work offers insights into the significance of reset assumptions in the framework of DCIL and proposes SR-DCIL, a first step toward a versatile algorithm capable of learning control policies under a weaker reset assumption.</p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offer training efficiency on Large Language Models, but their impact on model performance remains limited.Recent efforts integrate LoRA and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve the performance of PEFT methods.Despite promising results, research on improving the efficiency of LoRA with MoE is still in its early stages.Recent studies have shown that experts in the MoE architecture have different strengths and also exhibit some redundancy.Does this statement also apply to parameter-efficient MoE?In this paper, we introduce a novel parameter-efficient MoE method, \textit{\textbf{M}oE-L\textbf{o}RA with \textbf{L}ayer-wise Expert \textbf{A}llocation (MoLA)} for Transformer-based models, where each model layer has the flexibility to employ a varying number of LoRA experts.We investigate several architectures with varying layer-wise expert configurations.Experiments on six well-known NLP and commonsense QA benchmarks demonstrate that MoLA achieves equal or superior performance compared to all baselines.We find that allocating more LoRA experts to higher layers further enhances the effectiveness of models with a certain number of experts in total.With much fewer parameters, this allocation strategy outperforms the setting with the same number of experts in every layer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work can be widely used as a plug-and-play parameter-efficient tuning approach for various applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/GCYZSL/MoLA.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising class of generative models that map noisy inputs to realistic images.More recently, they have been employed to generate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs).However, they still struggle with inverse problems in the Laplacian operator, for instance, the Poisson equation, because the eigenvalues that are large in magnitude amplify the measurement noise.This paper presents a novel approach for the inverse and forward solution of PDEs through the use of denoising diffusion restoration models (DDRM).DDRMs were used in linear inverse problems to restore original clean signals by exploiting the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the linear operator.Equivalently, we present an approach to restore the solution and the parameters in the Poisson equation by exploiting the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that using denoising diffusion restoration significantly improves the estimation of the solution and parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our research, as a result, pioneers the integration of diffusion models with the principles of underlying physics to solve PDEs.</p>

                  <p>Large, distributed data streams are now ubiquitous.High-accuracy sketches with low memory overhead have become the de facto method for analyzing this data.For instance, if we wish to group data by some label and report the largest counts using fixed memory, we need to turn to mergeable heavy hitter sketches that can provide highly accurate approximate counts.Similarly, if we wish to keep track of the number of distinct items in a single set spread across several streams using fixed memory, we can turn to mergeable count distinct sketches that can provide highly accurate set cardinalities.   If we were to try to keep track of the cardinality of multiple sets and report only on the largest ones, maintaining individual count distinct sketches for each set can grow unwieldy, especially if the number of sets is not known in advance.We consider the natural combination of the heavy hitters problem with the count distinct problem, the heavy distinct hitters problem: given a stream of $(\ell, x)$ pairs, find all the labels $\ell$ that are paired with a large number of distinct items $x$ using only constant memory.   No previous work on heavy distinct hitters has managed to be of practical use in the large, distributed data stream setting.We propose a new algorithm, the Sampling Space-Saving Set Sketch, which combines sketching and sampling techniques and has all the desired properties for size, speed, accuracy, mergeability, and invertibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our algorithm to several existing solutions to the heavy distinct hitters problem, and provide experimental results across several data sets showing the superiority of the new sketch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>We classify the regular languages using an operator $\mathcal{C}\mapsto TL(\mathcal{C})$.For each input class of languages $\mathcal{C}$, it builds a larger class $TL(\mathcal{C})$ consisting of all languages definable in a variant of unary temporal logic whose future/past modalities depend on $\mathcal{C}$. This defines the temporal hierarchy of basis $\mathcal{C}$: level $n$ is built by applying this operator $n$ times to $\mathcal{C}$. This hierarchy is closely related to another one, the concatenation hierarchy of basis $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, the union of all levels in both hierarchies is the same.   We focus on bases $\mathcal{G}$ of group languages and natural extensions thereof, denoted $\mathcal{G}^+$. We prove that the temporal hierarchies of bases $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}^+$ are strictly intertwined, and we compare them to the corresponding concatenation hierarchies.Furthermore, we look at two standard problems on classes of languages: membership (decide if an input language is in the class) and separation (decide, for two input regular languages $L_1,L_2$, if there is a language $K$ in the class with $L_1 \subseteq K$ and $L_2 \cap K = \emptyset$).We prove that if separation is decidable for $\mathcal{G}$, then so is membership for level two in the temporal hierarchies of bases $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}^+$. Moreover, we take a closer look at the case where $\mathcal{G}$ is the trivial class $ST=\{\emptyset,A^*\}$.The levels one in the hierarchies of bases $ST$ and $ST^+$ are the standard variants of unary temporal logic while the levels two were considered recently using alternate definitions.We prove that for these two bases, level two has decidable separation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Combined with earlier results about the operator $\mathcal{G}\mapsto TL(\mathcal{G})$, this implies that the levels three have decidable membership. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>The convergence of generative AI and web search is reshaping problem-solving for programmers.However, the lack of understanding regarding their interplay in the information-seeking process often leads programmers to perceive them as alternatives rather than complementary tools.To analyze this interaction and explore their synergy, we conducted an interview study with eight experienced programmers.Drawing from the results and literature, we have identified three major challenges and proposed three decision-making stages, each with its own relevant factors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present a comprehensive process model that captures programmers' interaction patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This model encompasses decision-making stages, the information-foraging loop, and cognitive activities during system interaction, offering a holistic framework to comprehend and optimize the use of these convergent tools in programming.</p>
