                  <p>Image safety classifiers play an important role in identifying and mitigating the spread of unsafe images online (e.g., images including violence, hateful rhetoric, etc.).At the same time, with the advent of text-to-image models and increasing concerns about the safety of AI models, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to safeguard their models.Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for real-world and AI-generated images.To bridge this research gap, in this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models.Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough in mitigating the multifaceted problem of unsafe images.Also, we find that classifiers trained only on real-world images tend to have degraded performance when applied to AI-generated images.Motivated by these findings, we design and implement a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which effectively identifies 11 categories of real-world and AI-generated unsafe images.The best PerspectiveVision model achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.810 on six evaluation datasets, which is comparable with closed-source and expensive state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</p>

                  <p>Inspired by the great potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex coding tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Code2API, to automatically perform APIzation for Stack Overflow code snippets.Code2API does not require additional model training or any manual crafting rules and can be easily deployed on personal computers without relying on other external tools.Specifically, Code2API guides the LLMs through well-designed prompts to generate well-formed APIs for given code snippets.To elicit knowledge and logical reasoning from LLMs, we used chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and few-shot in-context learning, which can help the LLMs fully understand the APIzation task and solve it step by step in a manner similar to a developer.Our evaluations show that Code2API achieves a remarkable accuracy in identifying method parameters (65%) and return statements (66%) equivalent to human-generated ones, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approach, APIzator, by 15.0% and 16.5% respectively.Moreover, compared with APIzator, our user study demonstrates that Code2API exhibits superior performance in generating meaningful method names, even surpassing the human-level performance, and developers are more willing to use APIs generated by our approach, highlighting the applicability of our tool in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we successfully extend our framework to the Python dataset, achieving a comparable performance with Java, which verifies the generalizability of our tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of Video Large Multi-modal Models (Video-LMMs) that can handle a wide range of video understanding tasks.These models have the potential to be deployed in real-world applications such as robotics, AI assistants, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.The widespread adoption of Video-LMMs in our daily lives underscores the importance of ensuring and evaluating their robust performance in mirroring human-like reasoning and interaction capabilities in complex, real-world contexts.However, existing benchmarks for Video-LMMs primarily focus on general video comprehension abilities and neglect assessing their reasoning capabilities over complex videos in the real-world context, and robustness of these models through the lens of user prompts as text queries.In this paper, we present the Complex Video Reasoning and Robustness Evaluation Suite (CVRR-ES), a novel benchmark that comprehensively assesses the performance of Video-LMMs across 11 diverse real-world video dimensions.We evaluate 9 recent models, including both open-source and closed-source variants, and find that most of the Video-LMMs, {especially open-source ones,} struggle with robustness and reasoning when dealing with complex videos.Based on our analysis, we develop a training-free Dual-Step Contextual Prompting (DSCP) technique to enhance the performance of existing Video-LMMs.Our findings provide valuable insights for building the next generation of human-centric AI systems with advanced robustness and reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are publicly available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/CVRR-Evaluation-Suite/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks.However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved.The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective.In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks.Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points.We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks.We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2.Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we begin to investigate the possibility of training a deep neural network on the task of binary code understanding.Specifically, the network would take, as input, features derived directly from binaries and output English descriptions of functionality to aid a reverse engineer in investigating the capabilities of a piece of closed-source software, be it malicious or benign.Given recent success in applying large language models (generative AI) to the task of source code summarization, this seems a promising direction.However, in our initial survey of the available datasets, we found nothing of sufficiently high quality and volume to train these complex models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we build our own dataset derived from a capture of Stack Overflow containing 1.1M entries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>A major result of our work is a novel dataset evaluation method using the correlation between two distances on sample pairs: one distance in the embedding space of inputs and the other in the embedding space of outputs.Intuitively, if two samples have inputs close in the input embedding space, their outputs should also be close in the output embedding space.We found this Embedding Distance Correlation (EDC) test to be highly diagnostic, indicating that our collected dataset and several existing open-source datasets are of low quality as the distances are not well correlated.We proceed to explore the general applicability of EDC, applying it to a number of qualitatively known good datasets and a number of synthetically known bad ones and found it to be a reliable indicator of dataset value.</p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a category of Federated Learning in which models are trained collaboratively among parties with vertically partitioned data.Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner.Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels.These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL.In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that by applying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacks decreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of the whole VFL almost unaltered. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Numerous DL-based approaches have garnered considerable attention in the field of software Log Anomaly Detection.However, a practical challenge persists: the class imbalance in the public data commonly used to train the DL models.This imbalance is characterized by a substantial disparity in the number of abnormal log sequences compared to normal ones, for example, anomalies represent less than 1% of one of the most popular datasets.Previous research has indicated that existing DLLAD approaches may exhibit unsatisfactory performance, particularly when confronted with datasets featuring severe class imbalances.Mitigating class imbalance through data resampling has proven effective for other software engineering tasks, however, it has been unexplored for LAD thus far.This study aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of diverse data resampling methods on existing DLLAD approaches from two distinct perspectives.Firstly, we assess the performance of these DLLAD approaches across three datasets and explore the impact of resampling ratios of normal to abnormal data on ten data resampling methods.Secondly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the data resampling methods when utilizing optimal resampling ratios of normal to abnormal data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that oversampling methods generally outperform undersampling and hybrid methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Data resampling on raw data yields superior results compared to data resampling in the feature space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In most cases, certain undersampling and hybrid methods show limited effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Additionally, by exploring the resampling ratio of normal to abnormal data, we suggest generating more data for minority classes through oversampling while removing less data from majority classes through undersampling.In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the intricate relationship between data resampling methods and DLLAD.</p>

                  <p>Context.Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development.Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software.However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools.Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.   Goal.In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.   Method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.   Results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand.Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart.Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.   Conclusions.According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so.Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

                  <p>Graph augmentation has received great attention in recent years for graph contrastive learning (GCL) to learn well-generalized node/graph representations.However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation, which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level graph information, i.e., the graph community.Moreover, current knowledge-based graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing the model to lack robustness against various types of noise.To address these limitations, this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation.Based on our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph community structure during learnable graph augmentation.By maximizing the spectral changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Code is released on Github (https://github.com/ShiyinTan/CI-GCL.git).</p>

                  <p>Invariant risk minimization (IRM) is an arising approach to generalize invariant features to different environments in machine learning.While most related works focus on new IRM settings or new application scenarios, the mathematical essence of IRM remains to be properly explained.We verify that IRM is essentially a total variation based on $L^2$ norm (TV-$\ell_2$) of the learning risk with respect to the classifier variable.Moreover, we propose a novel IRM framework based on the TV-$\ell_1$ model.It not only expands the classes of functions that can be used as the learning risk, but also has robust performance in denoising and invariant feature preservation based on the coarea formula.We also illustrate some requirements for IRM-TV-$\ell_1$ to achieve out-of-distribution generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance in several benchmark machine learning scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML).The interest is driven by the numerous situations in real-life applications where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously.A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which illustrates the inherent trade-offs between objectives.Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature that could serve as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners who want to use MOO.Hence, our goal in this paper is to produce such a resource.We critically review previous studies, particularly those involving MOO in deep learning (using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a guiding example), and identify misconceptions that highlight the need for a better grasp of MOO principles in ML.Using MOO of PINNs as a case study, we demonstrate the interplay between the data loss and the physics loss terms.We highlight the most common pitfalls one should avoid while using MOO techniques in ML.We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more complex techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA).Additionally, we compare the results obtained from the WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence can result in inaccurate outcomes and, consequently, a non-optimal solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our goal is to offer a clear and practical guide for ML practitioners to effectively apply MOO, particularly in the context of DL.</p>

                  <p>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine temporal information with GNNs to capture structural, temporal, and contextual relationships in dynamic graphs simultaneously, leading to enhanced performance in various applications.As the demand for dynamic GNNs continues to grow, numerous models and frameworks have emerged to cater to different application needs.There is a pressing need for a comprehensive survey that evaluates the performance, strengths, and limitations of various approaches in this domain.This paper aims to fill this gap by offering a thorough comparative analysis and experimental evaluation of dynamic GNNs.It covers 81 dynamic GNN models with a novel taxonomy, 12 dynamic GNN training frameworks, and commonly used benchmarks.We also conduct experimental results from testing representative nine dynamic GNN models and three frameworks on six standard graph datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation metrics focus on convergence accuracy, training efficiency, and GPU memory usage, enabling a thorough comparison of performance across various models and frameworks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>From the analysis and evaluation results, we identify key challenges and offer principles for future research to enhance the design of models and frameworks in the dynamic GNNs field.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution.Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem.When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches.To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation.This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex.Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup.Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>For autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) deployed in suburban neighborhoods and other human-centric environments the problem of localization remains a fundamental challenge.There are well established methods for localization with GPS, lidar, and cameras.But even in ideal conditions these have limitations.GPS is not always available and is often not accurate enough on its own, visual methods have difficulty coping with appearance changes due to weather and other factors, and lidar methods are prone to defective solutions due to ambiguous scene geometry.Radar on the other hand is not highly susceptible to these problems, owing in part to its longer range.Further, radar is also robust to challenging conditions that interfere with vision and lidar including fog, smoke, rain, and darkness.We present a radar-based localization system that includes a novel method for highly-accurate radar odometry for smooth, high-frequency relative pose estimation and a novel method for radar-based place recognition and relocalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present experiments demonstrating our methods' accuracy and reliability, which are comparable with \new{other methods' published results for radar localization and we find outperform a similar method as ours applied to lidar measurements}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Further, we show our methods are lightweight enough to run on common low-power embedded hardware with ample headroom for other autonomy functions.</p>

To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs.ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing.We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types.Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats.   ParaGrapher is available online on https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher/.</p>
