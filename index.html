                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, yet their potential in more challenging and domain-specific task, such as finance, has not been fully explored.In this paper, we present CFinBench: a meticulously crafted, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark to date, for assessing the financial knowledge of LLMs under Chinese context.In practice, to better align with the career trajectory of Chinese financial practitioners, we build a systematic evaluation from 4 first-level categories: (1) Financial Subject: whether LLMs can memorize the necessary basic knowledge of financial subjects, such as economics, statistics and auditing.(2) Financial Qualification: whether LLMs can obtain the needed financial qualified certifications, such as certified public accountant, securities qualification and banking qualification.(3) Financial Practice: whether LLMs can fulfill the practical financial jobs, such as tax consultant, junior accountant and securities analyst.(4) Financial Law: whether LLMs can meet the requirement of financial laws and regulations, such as tax law, insurance law and economic law.CFinBench comprises 99,100 questions spanning 43 second-level categories with 3 question types: single-choice, multiple-choice and judgment.We conduct extensive experiments of 50 representative LLMs with various model size on CFinBench.The results show that GPT4 and some Chinese-oriented models lead the benchmark, with the highest average accuracy being 60.16%, highlighting the challenge presented by CFinBench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://cfinbench.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

                  <p>Paraphrases represent a human's intuitive ability to understand expressions presented in various different ways.Current paraphrase evaluations of language models primarily use binary approaches, offering limited interpretability of specific text changes.Atomic paraphrase types (APT) decompose paraphrases into different linguistic changes and offer a granular view of the flexibility in linguistic expression (e.g., a shift in syntax or vocabulary used).In this study, we assess the human preferences towards ChatGPT in generating English paraphrases with ten APTs and five prompting techniques.We introduce APTY (Atomic Paraphrase TYpes), a dataset of 500 sentence-level and word-level annotations by 15 annotators.The dataset also provides a human preference ranking of paraphrases with different types that can be used to fine-tune models with RLHF and DPO methods.Our results reveal that ChatGPT can generate simple APTs, such as additions and deletions, but struggle with complex structures (e.g., subordination changes).This study contributes to understanding which aspects of paraphrasing language models have already succeeded at understanding and what remains elusive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, our curated datasets can be used to develop language models with specific linguistic capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to systems and remain undetected for extended periods.To evade detection, APT cyberattacks deceive defense layers with breaches and exploits, thereby complicating exposure by traditional anomaly detection-based security methods.The challenge of detecting APTs with machine learning is compounded by the rarity of relevant datasets and the significant imbalance in the data, which makes the detection process highly burdensome.We present AE-APT, a deep learning-based tool for APT detection that features a family of AutoEncoder methods ranging from a basic one to a Transformer-based one.We evaluated our tool on a suite of provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004% of the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>The outcomes showed that AE-APT has significantly higher detection rates compared to its competitors, indicating superior performance in detecting and ranking anomalies.</p>

                  <p>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to our interaction with digital devices.Recently, growing efforts have been made to build models for various GUI understanding tasks.However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (SPR) task.This task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the SPR task.Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree.Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements.Such layout information is crucial for accurately interpreting information on the screen, distinguishing our ToL agent from other screen reading tools.We also thoroughly evaluate the ToL agent against other baselines on a newly proposed SPR benchmark, which includes GUIs from mobile, web, and operating systems.Last but not least, we test the ToL agent on mobile GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating its utility in identifying incorrect actions along the path of agent execution trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data: screen-point-and-read.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating ambient sounds and effects is a challenging problem due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task.In this work, we tackle the problem by introducing two new models.First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model.We show that by leveraging metadata available with the audio modality, we can substantially improve the quality of captions.AutoCap reaches CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then use AutoCap to caption clips from existing datasets, obtaining 761,000 audio clips with high-quality captions, forming the largest available audio-text dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters and train with our new dataset.When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 15.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works.This shows that the quality of data is often as important as its quantity.Besides, since AutoCap is fully automatic, new audio samples can be added to the training dataset, unlocking the training of even larger generative models for audio synthesis.</p>

                  <p>Chart understanding plays a pivotal role when applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to real-world tasks such as analyzing scientific papers or financial reports.However, existing datasets often focus on oversimplified and homogeneous charts with template-based questions, leading to an over-optimistic measure of progress.We demonstrate that although open-source models can appear to outperform strong proprietary models on these benchmarks, a simple stress test with slightly different charts or questions can deteriorate performance by up to 34.5%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose CharXiv, a comprehensive evaluation suite involving 2,323 natural, challenging, and diverse charts from arXiv papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>CharXiv includes two types of questions: 1) descriptive questions about examining basic chart elements and 2) reasoning questions that require synthesizing information across complex visual elements in the chart.To ensure quality, all charts and questions are handpicked, curated, and verified by human experts.Our results reveal a substantial, previously underestimated gap between the reasoning skills of the strongest proprietary model (i.e., GPT-4o), which achieves 47.1% accuracy, and the strongest open-source model (i.e., InternVL Chat V1.5), which achieves 29.2%.All models lag far behind human performance of 80.5%, underscoring weaknesses in the chart understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs.We hope CharXiv facilitates future research on MLLM chart understanding by providing a more realistic and faithful measure of progress.Project page and leaderboard: https://charxiv.github.io/</p>

                  <p>We propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation benchmark, ChronoMagic-Bench, to evaluate the temporal and metamorphic capabilities of the T2V models (e.g. Sora and Lumiere) in time-lapse video generation.In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on the visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence.The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query.For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories.This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations.To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence.MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity.Based on the ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce MultiDiff, a novel approach for consistent novel view synthesis of scenes from a single RGB image.The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature, as there exist multiple, plausible explanations for unobserved areas.To address this issue, we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models.Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views, increasing geometric stability.The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes, allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images.In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation, MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements, while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude.For additional consistency and image quality improvements, we introduce a novel, structured noise distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate that MultiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging, real-world datasets RealEstate10K and ScanNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Finally, our model naturally supports multi-view consistent editing without the need for further tuning.</p>

                  <p>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many.One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature.Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature.However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence.We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases.We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102).Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84.We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews.Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with hallucinations in visual instruction following task(s), limiting their trustworthiness and real-world applicability.We propose Pelican -- a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification.Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates.These sub-claims consist of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph.We then use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools.Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification.We finally use reasoning abilities of LLM to verify the correctness of the the claim by considering the consistency and confidence of the (question, answer) pairs from each sub-claim.Our experiments reveal a drop in hallucination rate by $\sim$8%-32% across various baseline LVLMs and a 27% drop compared to approaches proposed for hallucination mitigation on MMHal-Bench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results on two other benchmarks further corroborate our results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>In batch Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for a kernel function $f$, we are given as input $2n$ points $x^{(1)}, \cdots, x^{(n)}, y^{(1)}, \cdots, y^{(n)}$ in dimension $m$, as well as a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$. These inputs implicitly define the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ given by $K[i,j] = f(x^{(i)}, y^{(j)})$.The goal is to compute a vector $v$ which approximates $K w$ with $|| Kw - v||_\infty <\varepsilon ||w||_1$.A recent line of work has proved fine-grained lower bounds conditioned on SETH.Backurs et al.first showed the hardness of KDE for Gaussian-like kernels with high dimension $m = \Omega(\log n)$ and large scale $B = \Omega(\log n)$. Alman et al. later developed new reductions in roughly this same parameter regime, leading to lower bounds for more general kernels, but only for very small error $\varepsilon < 2^{- \log^{\Omega(1)} (n)}$.   In this paper, we refine the approach of Alman et al. to show new lower bounds in all parameter regimes, closing gaps between the known algorithms and lower bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the setting where $m = C\log n$ and $B = o(\log n)$, we prove Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve additive error $\varepsilon < \Omega(m/B)^{-m}$, matching the performance of the polynomial method up to low-order terms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>In the low dimensional setting $m = o(\log n)$, we show that Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve $\varepsilon$ such that $\log \log (\varepsilon^{-1}) >\tilde \Omega ((\log n)/m)$, matching the error bound achievable by FMM up to low-order terms.To our knowledge, no nontrivial lower bound was previously known in this regime.   Our new lower bounds make use of an intricate analysis of a special case of the kernel matrix -- the `counting matrix'.As a key technical lemma, we give a novel approach to bounding the entries of its inverse by using Schur polynomials from algebraic combinatorics.</p>

                  <p>The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts.Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -- specifically large language models (LLMs) -- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs.Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications.However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.   In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

                  <p>Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses.Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers.Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.   To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus.T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains.To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection.Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise.However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries.Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored.To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode.Specifically, we construct the first malware summaries, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort.At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS dataset and a benign pseudocode dataset.Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary.Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting the usability, accuracy, and completeness of summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT.Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger ChatGPT3.5.</p>

                  <p>The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution.We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses.First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment.Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation.Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response.Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models?Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning.A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other.Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis.They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/thomlake/investigating-alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings.In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution.Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Ann. Probab. 1982] provided an upper bound on the worst-case approximation ratio that was later matched by an algorithm of Correa et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>[Math. Oper.Res. 2021].The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy.A similar result for $k>1$ has remained elusive.   In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality.To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</p>

                  <p>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket.Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket.Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types.While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity.Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address this, we propose BADGER:Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement.BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins.Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV).ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor.By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model.We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods.We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with hallucinations in visual instruction following task(s), limiting their trustworthiness and real-world applicability.We propose Pelican -- a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification.Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates.These sub-claims consist of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph.We then use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools.Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We finally use reasoning abilities of LLM to verify the correctness of the the claim by considering the consistency and confidence of the (question, answer) pairs from each sub-claim. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>Our experiments reveal a drop in hallucination rate by $\sim$8%-32% across various baseline LVLMs and a 27% drop compared to approaches proposed for hallucination mitigation on MMHal-Bench.Results on two other benchmarks further corroborate our results.</p>

In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates.We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

                  <p>Bug localization refers to the identification of source code files which is in a programming language and also responsible for the unexpected behavior of software using the bug report, which is a natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As bug localization is labor-intensive, bug localization models are employed to assist software developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Due to the domain difference between source code files and bug reports, modern bug-localization systems, based on deep learning models, rely heavily on embedding techniques that project bug reports and source code files into a shared vector space.The creation of an embedding involves several design choices, but the impact of these choices on the quality of embedding and the performance of bug localization models remains unexplained in current research.   To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>

                  <p>Mitigating biases in generative AI and, particularly in text-to-image models, is of high importance given their growing implications in society.The biased datasets used for training pose challenges in ensuring the responsible development of these models, and mitigation through hard prompting or embedding alteration, are the most common present solutions.Our work introduces a novel approach to achieve diverse and inclusive synthetic images by learning a direction in the latent space and solely modifying the initial Gaussian noise provided for the diffusion process.Maintaining a neutral prompt and untouched embeddings, this approach successfully adapts to diverse debiasing scenarios, such as geographical biases.Moreover, our work proves it is possible to linearly combine these learned latent directions to introduce new mitigations, and if desired, integrate it with text embedding adjustments.Furthermore, text-to-image models lack transparency for assessing bias in outputs, unless visually inspected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, we provide a tool to empower developers to select their desired concepts to mitigate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>The project page with code is available online.</p>
