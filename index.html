                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are commonly used for long-form question answering, which requires them to generate paragraph-length answers to complex questions.While long-form QA has been well-studied in English via many different datasets and evaluation metrics, this research has not been extended to cover most other languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we introduce CaLMQA, a collection of 2.6K complex questions spanning 23 languages, including under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset includes both naturally-occurring questions collected from community web forums as well as questions written by native speakers, whom we hire for this purpose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Our process yields diverse, complex questions that reflect cultural topics (e.g. traditions, laws, news) and the language usage of native speakers.We conduct automatic evaluation across a suite of open- and closed-source models using our novel metric CaLMScore, which detects incorrect language and token repetitions in answers, and observe that the quality of LLM-generated answers degrades significantly for some low-resource languages.We perform human evaluation on a subset of models and see that model performance is significantly worse for culturally specific questions than for culturally agnostic questions.Our findings highlight the need for further research in LLM multilingual capabilities and non-English LFQA evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Identifying user's opinions and stances in long conversation threads on various topics can be extremely critical for enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, conflict resolution, targeted advertising, and content moderation.Hence, training language models to automate this task is critical.However, to train such models, gathering manual annotations has multiple challenges: 1) It is time-consuming and costly; 2) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing chances of noisy annotations; and 3) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly.Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we leverage Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the human annotation process on the following two tasks while also providing reasoning: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance of a post in a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which deals with labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale.The majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from these two LLMs on 764 multi-user Reddit conversations helps us curate the USDC dataset.USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models for the 5-class stance and 4-class dogmatism classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/USDC-0F7F]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene graph generation (SGG) in satellite imagery (SAI) benefits promoting intelligent understanding of geospatial scenarios from perception to cognition.In SAI, objects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist rich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects), which makes it necessary to holistically conduct SGG in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) SAI.However, the lack of SGG datasets with large-size VHR SAI has constrained the advancement of SGG in SAI.Due to the complexity of large-size VHR SAI, mining triplets <subject, relationship, object> in large-size VHR SAI heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning.Consequently, SGG models designed for small-size natural imagery are not directly applicable to large-size VHR SAI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the scarcity of datasets, this paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in large-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from 512 x 768 to 27,860 x 31,096 pixels, named RSG, encompassing over 210,000 objects and more than 400,000 triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>To realize SGG in large-size VHR SAI, we propose a context-aware cascade cognition (CAC) framework to understand SAI at three levels: object detection (OBD), pair pruning and relationship prediction.As a fundamental prerequisite for SGG in large-size SAI, a holistic multi-class object detection network (HOD-Net) that can flexibly integrate multi-scale contexts is proposed.With the consideration that there exist a huge amount of object pairs in large-size SAI but only a minority of object pairs contain meaningful relationships, we design a pair proposal generation (PPG) network via adversarial reconstruction to select high-value pairs.Furthermore, a relationship prediction network with context-aware messaging (RPCM) is proposed to predict the relationship types of these pairs.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language MOT is a crucial tracking problem and has drawn increasing attention recently.It aims to track objects based on human language commands, replacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks.Despite various efforts, a key challenge lies in the lack of a clear understanding of why language is used for tracking, which hinders further development in this field.In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, along with a corresponding large-scale benchmark, termed LaMOT, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions.Specially, LaMOT comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets and aims to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT.Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer.By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT.We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.</p>

                  <p>Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs presents unique challenges due to the large memory and computing requirements.Distributed GNN training, where the graph is partitioned across multiple machines, is a common approach to training GNNs on large graphs.However, as the graph cannot generally be decomposed into small non-interacting components, data communication between the training machines quickly limits training speeds.Compressing the communicated node activations by a fixed amount improves the training speeds, but lowers the accuracy of the trained GNN.In this paper, we introduce a variable compression scheme for reducing the communication volume in distributed GNN training without compromising the accuracy of the learned model.Based on our theoretical analysis, we derive a variable compression method that converges to a solution equivalent to the full communication case, for all graph partitioning schemes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical results show that our method attains a comparable performance to the one obtained with full communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>We outperform full communication at any fixed compression ratio for any communication budget.</p>

                  <p>The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution.We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses.First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment.Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation.Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response.Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models?Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning.A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other.Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis.They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/thomlake/investigating-alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Process discovery approaches analyze the business data to automatically uncover structured information, known as a process model.The quality of a process model is measured using quality dimensions -- completeness (replay fitness), preciseness, simplicity, and generalization.Traditional process discovery algorithms usually output a single process model.A single model may not accurately capture the observed behavior and overfit the training data.We have formed the process discovery problem in a multi-objective framework that yields several candidate solutions for the end user who can pick a suitable model based on the local environmental constraints (possibly varying).We consider the Binary Differential Evolution approach in a multi-objective framework for the task of process discovery.The proposed method employs dichotomous crossover/mutation operators.The parameters are tuned using Grey relational analysis combined with the Taguchi approach.{We have compared the proposed approach with the well-known single-objective algorithms and state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithm -- Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).}<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional comparison via computing a weighted average of the quality dimensions is also undertaken. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Results show that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and produces diversified candidate solutions that score high on the fitness functions.It is shown that the process models generated by the proposed approach are superior to or at least as good as those generated by the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

                  <p>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many.One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature.Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature.However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence.We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases.We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102).Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84.We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews.Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings.In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution.Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Ann. Probab. 1982] provided an upper bound on the worst-case approximation ratio that was later matched by an algorithm of Correa et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>[Math. Oper.Res. 2021].The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy.A similar result for $k>1$ has remained elusive.   In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality.To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</p>

We thus propose to consider the acquisition process from a signal-processing perspective.Given an object's geometry and a lighting environment, we estimate the properties of the materials on the object's surface in seconds.We do so by leveraging frequency domain analysis, considering the recovery of material properties as a deconvolution, enabling fast error estimation.We then quantify the uncertainty of the estimation, based on the available data, highlighting the areas for which priors or additional samples would be required for improved acquisition quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our approach to previous work and quantitatively evaluate our results, showing similar quality as previous work in a fraction of the time, and providing key information about the certainty of the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach.Effective HRL hinges on a suitable subgoal represen tation function, abstracting state space into latent subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors.Existing methods adopt a subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to latent subgoal space.Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the first probabilistic subgoal representation.Our method employs a GP prior on the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through learnable kernels.This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties.Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under diverse reward conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.</p>

                  <p>Digital human models of motion sickness have been actively developed, among which models based on subjective vertical conflict (SVC) theory are the most actively studied.These models facilitate the prediction of motion sickness in various scenarios such as riding in a car.Most SVC theory models predict the motion sickness incidence (MSI), which is defined as the percentage of people who would vomit with the given specific motion stimulus.However, no model has been developed to describe milder forms of discomfort or specific symptoms of motion sickness, even though predicting milder symptoms is important for applications in automobiles and daily use vehicles.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to build a computational model of symptom progression of vestibular motion sickness based on SVC theory.We focused on a model of vestibular motion sickness with six degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) head motions.The model was developed by updating the output part of the state-of-the-art SVC model, termed the 6DoF-SVC (IN1) model, from MSI to the MIsery SCale (MISC), which is a subjective rating scale for symptom progression.We conducted an experiment to measure the progression of motion sickness during a straight fore-aft motion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It was demonstrated that our proposed method, with the parameters of the output parts optimized by the experimental results, fits well with the observed MISC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>When machine learning (ML) models are used in applications that involve humans (e.g., online recommendation, school admission, hiring, lending), the model itself may trigger changes in the distribution of targeted data it aims to predict.Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that explicitly considers such model-dependent distribution shifts when learning ML models.While significant efforts have been devoted to finding performative stable (PS) solutions in PP for system robustness, their societal implications are less explored and it is unclear whether PS solutions are aligned with social norms such as fairness.In this paper, we set out to examine the fairness property of PS solutions in performative prediction.We first show that PS solutions can incur severe polarization effects and group-wise loss disparity.Although existing fairness mechanisms commonly used in literature can help mitigate unfairness, they may fail and disrupt the stability under model-dependent distribution shifts.We thus propose novel fairness intervention mechanisms that can simultaneously achieve both stability and fairness in PP settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both theoretical analysis and experiments are provided to validate the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Subsampling is commonly used to mitigate costs associated with data acquisition, such as time or energy requirements, motivating the development of algorithms for estimating the fully-sampled signal of interest $x$ from partially observed measurements $y$. In maximum-entropy sampling, one selects measurement locations that are expected to have the highest entropy, so as to minimize uncertainty about $x$.This approach relies on an accurate model of the posterior distribution over future measurements, given the measurements observed so far.Recently, diffusion models have been shown to produce high-quality posterior samples of high-dimensional signals using guided diffusion.In this work, we propose Active Diffusion Subsampling (ADS), a method for performing active subsampling using guided diffusion in which the model tracks a distribution of beliefs over the true state of $x$ throughout the reverse diffusion process, progressively decreasing its uncertainty by choosing to acquire measurements with maximum expected entropy, and ultimately generating the posterior distribution $p(x | y)$. ADS can be applied using pre-trained diffusion models for any subsampling rate, and does not require task-specific retraining - just the specification of a measurement model.Furthermore, the maximum entropy sampling policy employed by ADS is interpretable, enhancing transparency relative to existing methods using black-box policies.Experimentally, we show that ADS outperforms fixed sampling strategies, and study an application of ADS in Magnetic Resonance Imaging acceleration using the fastMRI dataset, finding that ADS performs competitively with supervised methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code available at https://active-diffusion-subsampling.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Interdicting a criminal with limited police resources is a challenging task as the criminal changes location over time.The size of the large transportation network further adds to the difficulty of this scenario.To tackle this issue, we consider the concept of a layered graph.At each time stamp, we create a copy of the entire transportation network to track the possible movements of both players, the attacker and the defenders.We consider a Stackelberg game in a dynamic crime scenario where the attacker changes location over time while the defenders attempt to interdict the attacker on his escape route.Given a set of defender strategies, the optimal attacker strategy is determined by applying Dijkstra's algorithm on the layered networks.Here, the attacker aims to minimize while the defenders aim to maximize the probability of interdiction.We develop an approximation algorithm on the layered networks to find near-optimal strategy for defenders.The efficacy of the developed approach is compared with the adopted MILP approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the results in terms of computational time and solution quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>The quality of the results demonstrates the need for the developed approach, as it effectively solves the complex problem within a short amount of time.</p>

                  <p>The most effective techniques to detect LLM-generated text rely on inserting a detectable signature -- or watermark -- during the model's decoding process.Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM's logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation.As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider.In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed.Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party.We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human assessments, highlighting the trade-off between quality and robustness to paraphrasing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>We release our code, outputs, and annotations at https://github.com/lilakk/PostMark.</p>

                  <p>Long-context capabilities are essential for large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex and long-input tasks.Despite numerous efforts made to optimize LLMs for long contexts, challenges persist in robustly processing long inputs.In this paper, we introduce GraphReader, a graph-based agent system designed to handle long texts by structuring them into a graph and employing an agent to explore this graph autonomously.Upon receiving a question, the agent first undertakes a step-by-step analysis and devises a rational plan.It then invokes a set of predefined functions to read node content and neighbors, facilitating a coarse-to-fine exploration of the graph.Throughout the exploration, the agent continuously records new insights and reflects on current circumstances to optimize the process until it has gathered sufficient information to generate an answer.Experimental results on the LV-Eval dataset reveal that GraphReader, using a 4k context window, consistently outperforms GPT-4-128k across context lengths from 16k to 256k by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approach demonstrates superior performance on four challenging single-hop and multi-hop benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains.Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications.In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source distribution to a target distribution.Under this new interpretation, these methods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image distribution (target).We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution.We show that calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF optimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real.We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</p>

                  <p>Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei et al., 2022).However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is expensive due to their large parameter counts.Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative by allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters.In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on structured unrestricted-rank matrices (SURM) which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs provides more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>This is achieved by using low displacement rank matrices (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before.SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget.SURMs achieve 5-7% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA.It also results in up to 12x reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Bug localization refers to the identification of source code files which is in a programming language and also responsible for the unexpected behavior of software using the bug report, which is a natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As bug localization is labor-intensive, bug localization models are employed to assist software developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Due to the domain difference between source code files and bug reports, modern bug-localization systems, based on deep learning models, rely heavily on embedding techniques that project bug reports and source code files into a shared vector space.The creation of an embedding involves several design choices, but the impact of these choices on the quality of embedding and the performance of bug localization models remains unexplained in current research.   To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>

                  <p>Mitigating biases in generative AI and, particularly in text-to-image models, is of high importance given their growing implications in society.The biased datasets used for training pose challenges in ensuring the responsible development of these models, and mitigation through hard prompting or embedding alteration, are the most common present solutions.Our work introduces a novel approach to achieve diverse and inclusive synthetic images by learning a direction in the latent space and solely modifying the initial Gaussian noise provided for the diffusion process.Maintaining a neutral prompt and untouched embeddings, this approach successfully adapts to diverse debiasing scenarios, such as geographical biases.Moreover, our work proves it is possible to linearly combine these learned latent directions to introduce new mitigations, and if desired, integrate it with text embedding adjustments.Furthermore, text-to-image models lack transparency for assessing bias in outputs, unless visually inspected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, we provide a tool to empower developers to select their desired concepts to mitigate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>The project page with code is available online.</p>
