                  <p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market.Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems.Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system.However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration.Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model.This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT).FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation.Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT.In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the source codes and datasets can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/FE-GUT/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced in conditional image generation.However, these models usually struggle with accurately rendering images featuring humans, resulting in distorted limbs and other anomalies.This issue primarily stems from the insufficient recognition and evaluation of limb qualities in diffusion models.To address this issue, we introduce AbHuman, the first large-scale synthesized human benchmark focusing on anatomical anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark consists of 56K synthesized human images, each annotated with detailed, bounding-box level labels identifying 147K human anomalies in 18 different categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.955</span></span>Based on this, the recognition of human anomalies can be established, which in turn enhances image generation through traditional techniques such as negative prompting and guidance.To further boost the improvement, we propose HumanRefiner, a novel plug-and-play approach for the coarse-to-fine refinement of human anomalies in text-to-image generation.Specifically, HumanRefiner utilizes a self-diagnostic procedure to detect and correct issues related to both coarse-grained abnormal human poses and fine-grained anomaly levels, facilitating pose-reversible diffusion generation.Experimental results on the AbHuman benchmark demonstrate that HumanRefiner significantly reduces generative discrepancies, achieving a 2.9x improvement in limb quality compared to the state-of-the-art open-source generator SDXL and a 1.4x improvement over DALL-E 3 in human evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Enderfga/HumanRefiner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions.However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software.Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs.Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations.OBJECTIVE:In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs.METHOD:First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks.A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>RESULTS:Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</p>

                  <p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn a model that can not only incrementally accommodate new classes, but also maintain the learned knowledge of old classes.Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in CIL is to retain this incremental learning ability, while being able to reject unknown samples that are drawn from different distributions of the learned classes.This capability is crucial to the safety of deploying CIL models in open worlds.However, despite remarkable advancements in the respective CIL and OOD detection, there lacks a systematic and large-scale benchmark to assess the capability of advanced CIL models in detecting OOD samples.To fill this gap, in this study we design a comprehensive empirical study to establish such a benchmark, named $\textbf{OpenCIL}$. To this end, we propose two principled frameworks for enabling four representative CIL models with 15 diverse OOD detection methods, resulting in 60 baseline models for OOD detection in CIL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical evaluation is performed on two popular CIL datasets with six commonly-used OOD datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>One key observation we find through our comprehensive evaluation is that the CIL models can be severely biased towards the OOD samples and newly added classes when they are exposed to open environments.Motivated by this, we further propose a new baseline for OOD detection in CIL, namely Bi-directional Energy Regularization ($\textbf{BER}$), which is specially designed to mitigate these two biases in different CIL models by having energy regularization on both old and new classes.Its superior performance is justified in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All codes and datasets are open-source at $https://github.com/mala-lab/OpenCIL$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>Absence of tamper-proof cattle identification technology was a significant problem preventing insurance companies from providing livestock insurance.This lack of technology had devastating financial consequences for marginal farmers as they did not have the opportunity to claim compensation for any unexpected events such as the accidental death of cattle in Bangladesh.Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we have solved the bottleneck of cattle identification by developing and introducing a muzzle-based cattle identification system.The uniqueness of cattle muzzles has been scientifically established, which resembles human fingerprints.This is the fundamental premise that prompted us to develop a cattle identification system that extracts the uniqueness of cattle muzzles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For this purpose, we collected 32,374 images from 826 cattle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span>Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with sharpening filters was applied in the preprocessing steps to remove noise from images.We used the YOLO algorithm for cattle muzzle detection in the image and the FaceNet architecture to learn unified embeddings from muzzle images using squared $L_2$ distances.Our system performs with an accuracy of $96.489\%$, $F_1$ score of $97.334\%$, and a true positive rate (tpr) of $87.993\%$ at a remarkably low false positive rate (fpr) of $0.098\%$. This reliable and efficient system for identifying cattle can significantly advance livestock insurance and precision farming.</p>

                  <p>Depression has proven to be a significant public health issue, profoundly affecting the psychological well-being of individuals.If it remains undiagnosed, depression can lead to severe health issues, which can manifest physically and even lead to suicide.Generally, Diagnosing depression or any other mental disorder involves conducting semi-structured interviews alongside supplementary questionnaires, including variants of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) by Clinicians and mental health professionals.This approach places significant reliance on the experience and judgment of trained physicians, making the diagnosis susceptible to personal biases.Given that the underlying mechanisms causing depression are still being actively researched, physicians often face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition, particularly in its early stages of clinical presentation.Recently, significant strides have been made in Artificial neural computing to solve problems involving text, image, and speech in various domains.Our analysis has aimed to leverage these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in our experiments to achieve optimal outcomes leveraging multiple modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments were performed on the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz dataset (E-DAIC) corpus presented in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019 Challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>The proposed solutions demonstrate better results achieved by Proprietary and Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), which achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.98 on Textual Modality, beating the AVEC 2019 challenge baseline results and current SOTA regression analysis architectures.Additionally, the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 71.43% in the classification task.The paper also includes a novel audio-visual multi-modal network that predicts PHQ-8 scores with an RMSE of 6.51.</p>

The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial.We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems.One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL).While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges.First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner.This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task.Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task.To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks.We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity.For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant advancements to code generation and code repair, benefiting both novice and experienced developers.However, their training using unsanitized data from open-source repositories, like GitHub, raises the risk of inadvertently propagating security vulnerabilities.Despite numerous studies investigating the safety of code LLMs, there remains a gap in comprehensively addressing their security features.In this work, we aim to present a comprehensive study aimed at precisely evaluating and enhancing the security aspects of code LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support our research, we introduce CodeSecEval, a meticulously curated dataset designed to address 44 critical vulnerability types with 180 distinct samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>CodeSecEval serves as the foundation for the automatic evaluation of code models in two crucial tasks: code generation and code repair, with a strong emphasis on security.Our experimental results reveal that current models frequently overlook security issues during both code generation and repair processes, resulting in the creation of vulnerable code.In response, we propose different strategies that leverage vulnerability-aware information and insecure code explanations to mitigate these security vulnerabilities.Furthermore, our findings highlight that certain vulnerability types particularly challenge model performance, influencing their effectiveness in real-world applications.Based on these findings, we believe our study will have a positive impact on the software engineering community, inspiring the development of improved methods for training and utilizing LLMs, thereby leading to safer and more trustworthy model deployment.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>Existing open-set recognition (OSR) studies typically assume that each image contains only one class label, and the unknown test set (negative) has a disjoint label space from the known test set (positive), a scenario termed full-label shift.This paper introduces the mixed OSR problem, where test images contain multiple class semantics, with known and unknown classes co-occurring in negatives, leading to a more challenging super-label shift.Addressing the mixed OSR requires classification models to accurately distinguish different class semantics within images and measure their "knowness".In this study, we propose the OpenSlot framework, built upon object-centric learning.OpenSlot utilizes slot features to represent diverse class semantics and produce class predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our proposed anti-noise-slot (ANS) technique, we mitigate the impact of noise (invalid and background) slots during classification training, effectively addressing the semantic misalignment between class predictions and the ground truth. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments with OpenSlot on mixed & conventional OSR benchmarks.Without elaborate designs, OpenSlot not only exceeds existing OSR studies in detecting super-label shifts across single & multi-label mixed OSR tasks but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional benchmarks.Remarkably, our method can localize class objects without using bounding boxes during training.The competitive performance in open-set object detection demonstrates OpenSlot's ability to explicitly explain label shifts and benefits in computational efficiency and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language MOT is a crucial tracking problem and has drawn increasing attention recently.It aims to track objects based on human language commands, replacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks.Despite various efforts, a key challenge lies in the lack of a clear understanding of why language is used for tracking, which hinders further development in this field.In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, along with a corresponding large-scale benchmark, termed LaMOT, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions.Specially, LaMOT comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets and aims to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT.Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer.By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT.We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.</p>

                  <p>A dynamic graph algorithm is a data structure that supports edge insertions, deletions, and specific problem queries.While extensive research exists on dynamic algorithms for graph problems solvable in polynomial time, most of these algorithms have not been implemented or empirically evaluated.   This work addresses the NP-complete maximum weight and cardinality independent set problems in a dynamic setting, applicable to areas like dynamic map-labeling and vehicle routing.Real-world instances can be vast, with millions of vertices and edges, making it challenging to find near-optimal solutions quickly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exact solvers can find optimal solutions but have exponential worst-case runtimes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Conversely, heuristic algorithms use local search techniques to improve solutions by optimizing vertices.   In this work, we introduce a novel local search technique called optimal neighborhood exploration.This technique creates independent subproblems that are solved to optimality, leading to improved overall solutions.Through numerous experiments, we assess the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art dynamic solvers.Our algorithm features a parameter, the subproblem size, that balances running time and solution quality.With this parameter, our configuration matches state-of-the-art performance for the cardinality independent set problem.By increasing the parameter, we significantly enhance solution quality.</p>

                  <p>FPGAs offer a flexible platform for accelerating deep neural network (DNN) inference, particularly for non-uniform workloads featuring fine-grained unstructured sparsity and mixed arithmetic precision.To leverage these redundancies, an emerging approach involves partially or fully unrolling computations for each DNN layer.That way, parameter-level and bit-level ineffectual operations can be completely skipped, thus saving the associated area and power.Regardless, unrolled implementations scale poorly and limit the size of a DNN that can be unrolled on an FPGA.This motivates the investigation of new reconfigurable architectures to improve the efficiency of unrolled DNNs, while taking advantage of sparsity and mixed precision.To enable this, we present Kratos: a focused FPGA benchmark of unrolled DNN primitives with varying levels of sparsity and different arithmetic precisions.Our analysis reveals that unrolled DNNs can operate at very high frequencies, reaching the maximum frequency limit of an Arria 10 device.Additionally, we found that substantial area reductions can be achieved through fine-grained sparsity and low bit-width.We build on those results to tailor the FPGA fabric for unrolled DNNs through an architectural case study demonstrating $\sim$2$\times$ area reduction when using smaller LUT sizes within current FPGAs.This paves the way for further exploration of new programmable architectures that are purpose-built for sparse and low-precision unrolled DNNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and benchmark are available on github.com/abdelfattah-lab/Kratos-benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span></p>

                  <p>Crowd counting is gaining societal relevance, particularly in domains of Urban Planning, Crowd Management, and Public Safety.This paper introduces Fourier-guided attention (FGA), a novel attention mechanism for crowd count estimation designed to address the inefficient full-scale global pattern capture in existing works on convolution-based attention networks.FGA efficiently captures multi-scale information, including full-scale global patterns, by utilizing Fast-Fourier Transformations (FFT) along with spatial attention for global features and convolutions with channel-wise attention for semi-global and local features.The architecture of FGA involves a dual-path approach: (1) a path for processing full-scale global features through FFT, allowing for efficient extraction of information in the frequency domain, and (2) a path for processing remaining feature maps for semi-global and local features using traditional convolutions and channel-wise attention.This dual-path architecture enables FGA to seamlessly integrate frequency and spatial information, enhancing its ability to capture diverse crowd patterns.We apply FGA in the last layers of two popular crowd-counting works, CSRNet and CANNet, to evaluate the module's performance on benchmark datasets such as ShanghaiTech-A, ShanghaiTech-B, UCF-CC-50, and JHU++ crowd.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate a notable improvement across all datasets based on Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) metrics, showing comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Additionally, we illustrate the interpretability using qualitative analysis, leveraging Grad-CAM heatmaps, to show the effectiveness of FGA in capturing crowd patterns.</p>

                  <p>Compositional actions consist of dynamic (verbs) and static (objects) concepts.Humans can easily recognize unseen compositions using the learned concepts.For machines, solving such a problem requires a model to recognize unseen actions composed of previously observed verbs and objects, thus requiring, so-called, compositional generalization ability.To facilitate this research, we propose a novel Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) task.For evaluating the task, we construct a new benchmark, Something-composition (Sth-com), based on the widely used Something-Something V2 dataset.We also propose a novel Component-to-Composition (C2C) learning method to solve the new ZS-CAR task.C2C includes an independent component learning module and a composition inference module.Last, we devise an enhanced training strategy to address the challenges of component variation between seen and unseen compositions and to handle the subtle balance between learning seen and unseen actions.The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly surpasses the existing compositional generalization methods and sets a new state-of-the-art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The new Sth-com benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/RongchangLi/ZSCAR_C2C. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Depression has proven to be a significant public health issue, profoundly affecting the psychological well-being of individuals.If it remains undiagnosed, depression can lead to severe health issues, which can manifest physically and even lead to suicide.Generally, Diagnosing depression or any other mental disorder involves conducting semi-structured interviews alongside supplementary questionnaires, including variants of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) by Clinicians and mental health professionals.This approach places significant reliance on the experience and judgment of trained physicians, making the diagnosis susceptible to personal biases.Given that the underlying mechanisms causing depression are still being actively researched, physicians often face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition, particularly in its early stages of clinical presentation.Recently, significant strides have been made in Artificial neural computing to solve problems involving text, image, and speech in various domains.Our analysis has aimed to leverage these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in our experiments to achieve optimal outcomes leveraging multiple modalities.The experiments were performed on the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz dataset (E-DAIC) corpus presented in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019 Challenge.The proposed solutions demonstrate better results achieved by Proprietary and Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), which achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.98 on Textual Modality, beating the AVEC 2019 challenge baseline results and current SOTA regression analysis architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 71.43% in the classification task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The paper also includes a novel audio-visual multi-modal network that predicts PHQ-8 scores with an RMSE of 6.51.</p>

                  <p>Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge.For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality.These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters.Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience.To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty.Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays.However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties.We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data.The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents reactive obstacle and self-collision avoidance of redundant robotic manipulators within real time kinematic feedback control using GPU-computed distance transform.The proposed framework utilizes discretized representation of the robot and the environment to calculate 3D Euclidean distance transform for task-priority based kinematic control.The environment scene is represented using a 3D GPU-voxel map created and updated from a live pointcloud data while the robotic link model is converted into a voxels offline and inserted into the voxel map according to the joint state of the robot to form the self-obstacle map.The proposed approach is evaluated using the Tiago robot, showing that all obstacle and self collision avoidance constraints are respected within one framework even with fast moving obstacles while the robot performs end-effector pose tracking in real time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparison of related works that depend on GPU and CPU computed distance fields is also presented to highlight the time performance as well as accuracy of the GPU distance field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>In batch Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for a kernel function $f$, we are given as input $2n$ points $x^{(1)}, \cdots, x^{(n)}, y^{(1)}, \cdots, y^{(n)}$ in dimension $m$, as well as a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$. These inputs implicitly define the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ given by $K[i,j] = f(x^{(i)}, y^{(j)})$.The goal is to compute a vector $v$ which approximates $K w$ with $|| Kw - v||_\infty <\varepsilon ||w||_1$.A recent line of work has proved fine-grained lower bounds conditioned on SETH.Backurs et al.first showed the hardness of KDE for Gaussian-like kernels with high dimension $m = \Omega(\log n)$ and large scale $B = \Omega(\log n)$. Alman et al. later developed new reductions in roughly this same parameter regime, leading to lower bounds for more general kernels, but only for very small error $\varepsilon < 2^{- \log^{\Omega(1)} (n)}$.   In this paper, we refine the approach of Alman et al. to show new lower bounds in all parameter regimes, closing gaps between the known algorithms and lower bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the setting where $m = C\log n$ and $B = o(\log n)$, we prove Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve additive error $\varepsilon < \Omega(m/B)^{-m}$, matching the performance of the polynomial method up to low-order terms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>In the low dimensional setting $m = o(\log n)$, we show that Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve $\varepsilon$ such that $\log \log (\varepsilon^{-1}) >\tilde \Omega ((\log n)/m)$, matching the error bound achievable by FMM up to low-order terms.To our knowledge, no nontrivial lower bound was previously known in this regime.   Our new lower bounds make use of an intricate analysis of a special case of the kernel matrix -- the `counting matrix'.As a key technical lemma, we give a novel approach to bounding the entries of its inverse by using Schur polynomials from algebraic combinatorics.</p>

                  <p>The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts.Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -- specifically large language models (LLMs) -- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs.Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications.However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.   In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

                  <p>One of the most critical tasks of Microsoft sellers is to meticulously track and nurture potential business opportunities through proactive engagement and tailored solutions.Recommender systems play a central role to help sellers achieve their goals.In this paper, we present a content recommendation model which surfaces various types of content (technical documentation, comparison with competitor products, customer success stories etc.) that sellers can share with their customers or use for their own self-learning.The model operates at the opportunity level which is the lowest possible granularity and the most relevant one for sellers.It is based on semantic matching between metadata from the contents and carefully selected attributes of the opportunities.Considering the volume of seller-managed opportunities in organizations such as Microsoft, we show how to perform efficient semantic matching over a very large number of opportunity-content combinations.The main challenge is to ensure that the top-5 relevant contents for each opportunity are recommended out of a total of $\approx 40,000$ published contents.We achieve this target through an extensive comparison of different model architectures and feature selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we further examine the quality of the recommendations in a quantitative manner using a combination of human domain experts as well as by using the recently proposed "LLM as a judge" framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model.Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input.It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility.However, this capability also introduces potential issues.For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests.As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions.This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies.We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions.We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text.Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline.NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials.Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.</p>
