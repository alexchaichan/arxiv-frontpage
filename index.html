                  <p>Remote sensing data provide a low-cost solution for large-scale monitoring of air pollution via the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), but is often limited by cloud contamination.Existing methods for AOD reconstruction rely on temporal information.However, for remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, multi-temporal observations are often unavailable.In this letter, we take advantage of deep representation learning from convolutional neural networks and propose Deep Feature Gaussian Processes (DFGP) for single-scene AOD reconstruction.By using deep learning, we transform the variables to a feature space with better explainable power.By using Gaussian processes, we explicitly consider the correlation between observed AOD and missing AOD in spatial and feature domains.Experiments on two AOD datasets with real-world cloud patterns showed that the proposed method outperformed deep CNN and random forest, achieving R$^2$ of 0.7431 on MODIS AOD and R$^2$ of 0.9211 on EMIT AOD, compared to deep CNN's R$^2$ of 0.6507 and R$^2$ of 0.8619.The proposed methods increased R$^2$ by over 0.35 compared to the popular random forest in AOD reconstruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code used in this study are available at \url{https://skrisliu.com/dfgp}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to obtain 3D fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene and is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving.Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources.To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features.We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics.We then propose an efficient Gaussian-to-voxel splatting method to generate 3D occupancy predictions, which only aggregates the neighboring Gaussians for a certain position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianFormer achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods with only 17.8% - 24.8% of their memory consumption.Code is available at: https://github.com/huang-yh/GaussianFormer.</p>

                  <p>In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training.In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences.HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory.We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%.Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains.Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating personalized 3D avatars is crucial for AR/VR.However, recent text-to-3D methods that generate avatars for celebrities or fictional characters, struggle with everyday people.Methods for faithful reconstruction typically require full-body images in controlled settings.What if a user could just upload their personal "OOTD" (Outfit Of The Day) photo collection and get a faithful avatar in return?The challenge is that such casual photo collections contain diverse poses, challenging viewpoints, cropped views, and occlusion (albeit with a consistent outfit, accessories and hairstyle).We address this novel "Album2Human" task by developing PuzzleAvatar, a novel model that generates a faithful 3D avatar (in a canonical pose) from a personal OOTD album, while bypassing the challenging estimation of body and camera pose.To this end, we fine-tune a foundational vision-language model (VLM) on such photos, encoding the appearance, identity, garments, hairstyles, and accessories of a person into (separate) learned tokens and instilling these cues into the VLM.In effect, we exploit the learned tokens as "puzzle pieces" from which we assemble a faithful, personalized 3D avatar.Importantly, we can customize avatars by simply inter-changing tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a benchmark for this new task, we collect a new dataset, called PuzzleIOI, with 41 subjects in a total of nearly 1K OOTD configurations, in challenging partial photos with paired ground-truth 3D bodies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>Evaluation shows that PuzzleAvatar not only has high reconstruction accuracy, outperforming TeCH and MVDreamBooth, but also a unique scalability to album photos, and strong robustness.Our model and data will be public.</p>

                  <p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set.However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline.To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers.While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100.Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy.Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever.This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).}Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset.Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and link to datasets are available at https://github.com/yc-song/cmc <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span></p>

                  <p>The success of autonomous navigation relies on robust and precise vehicle recognition, hindered by the scarcity of region-specific vehicle detection datasets, impeding the development of context-aware systems.To advance terrestrial object detection research, this paper proposes a native vehicle detection dataset for the most commonly appeared vehicle classes in Bangladesh.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>17 distinct vehicle classes have been taken into account, with fully annotated 81542 instances of 17326 images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>Each image width is set to at least 1280px.The dataset's average vehicle bounding box-to-image ratio is 4.7036.This Bangladesh Native Vehicle Dataset (BNVD) has accounted for several geographical, illumination, variety of vehicle sizes, and orientations to be more robust on surprised scenarios.In the context of examining the BNVD dataset, this work provides a thorough assessment with four successive You Only Look Once (YOLO) models, namely YOLO v5, v6, v7, and v8.These dataset's effectiveness is methodically evaluated and contrasted with other vehicle datasets already in use.The BNVD dataset exhibits mean average precision(mAP) at 50% intersection over union (IoU) is 0.848 corresponding precision and recall values of 0.841 and 0.774.The research findings indicate a mAP of 0.643 at an IoU range of 0.5 to 0.95.The experiments show that the BNVD dataset serves as a reliable representation of vehicle distribution and presents considerable complexities.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key information from unstructured documents.Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages.In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets.After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples.Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs.Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment.Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin.In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Scientist learn early on how to cite scientific sources to support their claims.Sometimes, however, scientists have challenges determining where a citation should be situated -- or, even worse, fail to cite a source altogether.Automatically detecting sentences that need a citation (i.e., citation worthiness) could solve both of these issues, leading to more robust and well-constructed scientific arguments.Previous researchers have applied machine learning to this task but have used small datasets and models that do not take advantage of recent algorithmic developments such as attention mechanisms in deep learning.We hypothesize that we can develop significantly accurate deep learning architectures that learn from large supervised datasets constructed from open access publications.In this work, we propose a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention mechanism and contextual information to detect sentences that need citations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also produce a new, large dataset (PMOA-CITE) based on PubMed Open Access Subset, which is orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>Our experiments show that our architecture achieves state of the art performance on the standard ACL-ARC dataset ($F_{1}=0.507$) and exhibits high performance ($F_{1}=0.856$) on the new PMOA-CITE.Moreover, we show that it can transfer learning across these datasets.We further use interpretable models to illuminate how specific language is used to promote and inhibit citations.We discover that sections and surrounding sentences are crucial for our improved predictions.We further examined purported mispredictions of the model, and uncovered systematic human mistakes in citation behavior and source data.This opens the door for our model to check documents during pre-submission and pre-archival procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make this new dataset, the code, and a web-based tool available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.937</span></span></p>

                  <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation.SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions.The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications.Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods.This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor.A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images.Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR.We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.This integrated approach yields remarkable results.In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>Suicide is a prominent issue in society.Unfortunately, many people at risk for suicide do not receive the support required.Barriers to people receiving support include social stigma and lack of access to mental health care.With the popularity of social media, people have turned to online forums, such as Reddit to express their feelings and seek support.This provides the opportunity to support people with the aid of artificial intelligence.Social media posts can be classified, using text classification, to help connect people with professional help.However, these systems fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in classifying mental health conditions.Unlike other areas of healthcare, mental health conditions have no objective measurements of disease often relying on expert opinion.Thus when formulating deep learning problems involving mental health, using hard, binary labels does not accurately represent the true nature of the data.In these settings, where human experts may disagree, fuzzy or soft labels may be more appropriate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The current work introduces a novel label smoothing method which we use to capture any uncertainty within the data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our approach on a five-label multi-class classification problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show, our semi-supervised deep label smoothing method improves classification accuracy above the existing state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Where existing research reports an accuracy of 43\% on the Reddit C-SSRS dataset, using empirical experiments to evaluate our novel label smoothing method, we improve upon this existing benchmark to 52\%.These improvements in model performance have the potential to better support those experiencing mental distress.Future work should explore the use of probabilistic methods in both natural language processing and quantifying contributions of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in noisy datasets.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>Coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) are gaining traction thanks to their performance and power efficiency.Utilizing CGRAs to accelerate the execution of tight loops holds great potential for achieving significant overall performance gains, as a substantial portion of program execution time is dedicated to tight loops.But loop parallelization using CGRAs is challenging because of loop-carried data dependencies.Traditionally, loop-carried dependencies are handled by spilling dependent values out of the reconfigurable array to a memory medium and then feeding them back to the grid.Spilling the values and feeding them back into the grid imposes additional latencies and logic that impede performance and limit parallelism.   In this paper, we present the Dependency Resolved CGRA (DR-CGRA) architecture that is designed to accelerate the execution of tight loops.DR-CGRA, which is based on a massively-multithreaded CGRA, runs each iteration as a separate CGRA thread and maps loop-carried data dependencies to inter-thread communication inside the grid.This design ensures the passage of data-dependent values across loop iterations without spilling them out of the grid.   The proposed DR-CGRA architecture was evaluated on various SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrated significant performance improvements, with an average speedup ranging from 2.1 to 4.5 and an overall average of 3.1 when compared to state-of-the-art CGRA architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>PAC-Bayesian analysis is a frequentist framework for incorporating prior knowledge into learning.It was inspired by Bayesian learning, which allows sequential data processing and naturally turns posteriors from one processing step into priors for the next.However, despite two and a half decades of research, the ability to update priors sequentially without losing confidence information along the way remained elusive for PAC-Bayes.While PAC-Bayes allows construction of data-informed priors, the final confidence intervals depend only on the number of points that were not used for the construction of the prior, whereas confidence information in the prior, which is related to the number of points used to construct the prior, is lost.This limits the possibility and benefit of sequential prior updates, because the final bounds depend only on the size of the final batch.   We present a novel and, in retrospect, surprisingly simple and powerful PAC-Bayesian procedure that allows sequential prior updates with no information loss.The procedure is based on a novel decomposition of the expected loss of randomized classifiers.The decomposition rewrites the loss of the posterior as an excess loss relative to a downscaled loss of the prior plus the downscaled loss of the prior, which is bounded recursively.As a side result, we also present a generalization of the split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities to discrete random variables, which we use for bounding the excess losses, and which can be of independent interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In empirical evaluation the new procedure significantly outperforms state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Creating realistic, natural, and lip-readable talking face videos remains a formidable challenge.Previous research primarily concentrated on generating and aligning single-frame images while overlooking the smoothness of frame-to-frame transitions and temporal dependencies.This often compromised visual quality and effects in practical settings, particularly when handling complex facial data and audio content, which frequently led to semantically incongruent visual illusions.Specifically, synthesized videos commonly featured disorganized lip movements, making them difficult to understand and recognize.To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the application of optical flow to guide facial image generation, enhancing inter-frame continuity and semantic consistency.We propose "OpFlowTalker", a novel approach that utilizes predicted optical flow changes from audio inputs rather than direct image predictions.This method smooths image transitions and aligns changes with semantic content.Moreover, it employs a sequence fusion technique to replace the independent generation of single frames, thus preserving contextual information and maintaining temporal coherence.We also developed an optical flow synchronization module that regulates both full-face and lip movements, optimizing visual synthesis by balancing regional dynamics.Furthermore, we introduce a Visual Text Consistency Score (VTCS) that accurately measures lip-readability in synthesized videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evidence validates the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights.Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage.While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities.In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the text rather than the marginal distribution of images.Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference.This indicator reduces the stochasticity in estimating the memorization of individual samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and scales. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies such as early stopping and data augmentation.</p>

                  <p>Discovering the semantics of multimodal utterances is essential for understanding human language and enhancing human-machine interactions.Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios.This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field.UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering.An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors.Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top-$K$ parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection.Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering.We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6\% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/thuiar/UMC.</p>

                  <p>Objective: In medical imaging, it is often crucial to accurately assess and correct movement during image-guided therapy.Deformable image registration (DIR) consists in estimating the required spatial transformation to align a moving image with a fixed one.However, it is acknowledged that, boundary conditions applied to the solution are critical in preventing mis-registration.Despite the extensive research on registration techniques, relatively few have addressed the issue of boundary conditions in the context of medical DIR.Our aim is a step towards customizing boundary conditions to suit the diverse registration tasks at hand.   Approach:We propose a generic, locally adaptive, Robin-type condition enabling to balance between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, depending on incoming/outgoing flow fields on the image boundaries.The proposed framework is entirely automatized through the determination of a reduced set of hyperparameters optimized via energy minimization.   Main results: The proposed approach was tested on a mono-modal CT thorax registration task and an abdominal CT to MRI registration task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the first task, we observed a relative improvement in terms of target registration error of up to 12% (mean 4%), compared to homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>For the second task, the automatic framework provides results closed to the best achievable.   Significance: This study underscores the importance of tailoring the registration problem at the image boundaries.In this research, we introduce a novel method to adapt the boundary conditions on a voxel-by-voxel basis, yielding optimized results in two distinct tasks: mono-modal CT thorax registration and abdominal CT to MRI registration.The proposed framework enables optimized boundary conditions in image registration without any a priori assumptions regarding the images or the motion.</p>

                  <p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set.However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline.To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers.While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever.This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).}Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset.Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).The code and link to datasets are available at https://github.com/yc-song/cmc</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims at generating human-like language to describe the semantic changes between bi-temporal remote sensing image pairs.It provides valuable insights into environmental dynamics and land management.Unlike conventional change captioning task, RSICC involves not only retrieving relevant information across different modalities and generating fluent captions, but also mitigating the impact of pixel-level differences on terrain change localization.The pixel problem due to long time span decreases the accuracy of generated caption.Inspired by the remarkable generative power of diffusion model, we propose a probabilistic diffusion model for RSICC to solve the aforementioned problems.In training process, we construct a noise predictor conditioned on cross modal features to learn the distribution from the real caption distribution to the standard Gaussian distribution under the Markov chain.Meanwhile, a cross-mode fusion and a stacking self-attention module are designed for noise predictor in the reverse process.In testing phase, the well-trained noise predictor helps to estimate the mean value of the distribution and generate change captions step by step.Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our Diffusion-RSCC and its individual components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The quantitative results showcase superior performance over existing methods across both traditional and newly augmented metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>The code and materials will be available online at https://github.com/Fay-Y/Diffusion-RSCC.</p>

                  <p>In the current era of digital communication and widespread use of social media, it is crucial to develop an understanding of persuasive techniques employed in written text.This knowledge is essential for effectively discerning accurate information and making informed decisions.To address this need, this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study focused on identifying persuasive techniques in Arabic social media content.To achieve this objective, we utilize Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and leverage the ArAlEval dataset, which encompasses two tasks: binary classification to determine the presence or absence of persuasion techniques, and multi-label classification to identify the specific types of techniques employed in the text.Our study explores three different learning approaches by harnessing the power of PLMs: feature extraction, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experimentation, we find that the fine-tuning approach yields the highest results on the aforementioned dataset, achieving an f1-micro score of 0.865 and an f1-weighted score of 0.861. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Furthermore, our analysis sheds light on an interesting finding.While the performance of the GPT model is relatively lower compared to the other approaches, we have observed that by employing few-shot learning techniques, we can enhance its results by up to 20\%.This offers promising directions for future research and exploration in this topic\footnote{Upon Acceptance, the source code will be released on GitHub.}.</p>

                  <p>Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance within complex illumination scenarios.However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch.This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems.To address this limitation, various knowledge distillation methods have been proposed.However, traditional distillation methods focus only on the fusion features and ignore the large amount of information in the original multi-modal features, thereby restricting the student network's performance.To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework, which can fully utilize the original modal features of the teacher network.Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms.This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module.Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection.Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/bigD233/AMFD.git.</p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This integrated approach yields remarkable results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we present an arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) method to enhance the resolution of scientific data, which often involves complex challenges such as continuity, multi-scale physics, and the intricacies of high-frequency signals.Grounded in operator learning, the proposed method is resolution-invariant.The core of our model is a hierarchical neural operator that leverages a Galerkin-type self-attention mechanism, enabling efficient learning of mappings between function spaces.Sinc filters are used to facilitate the information transfer across different levels in the hierarchy, thereby ensuring representation equivalence in the proposed neural operator.Additionally, we introduce a learnable prior structure that is derived from the spectral resizing of the input data.This loss prior is model-agnostic and is designed to dynamically adjust the weighting of pixel contributions, thereby balancing gradients effectively across the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets from different domains and demonstrate consistent improvements compared to strong baselines, which consist of various state-of-the-art SR methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>

                  <p>Cryptocurrency wallets, acting as fundamental infrastructure to the blockchain ecosystem, have seen significant user growth, particularly among browser-based wallets (i.e., browser extensions).However, this expansion accompanies security challenges, making these wallets prime targets for malicious activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite a substantial user base, there is not only a significant gap in comprehensive security analysis but also a pressing need for specialized tools that can aid developers in reducing vulnerabilities during the development process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To fill the void, we present a comprehensive security analysis of browser-based wallets in this paper, along with the development of an automated tool designed for this purpose.We first compile a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities resident in cryptocurrency wallets by harvesting historical security reports.Based on this, we design WALLETRADAR, an automated detection framework that can accurately identify security issues based on static and dynamic analysis.Evaluation of 96 popular browser-based wallets shows WALLETRADAR's effectiveness, by successfully automating the detection process in 90% of these wallets with high precision.This evaluation has led to the discovery of 116 security vulnerabilities corresponding to 70 wallets.By the time of this paper, we have received confirmations of 10 vulnerabilities from 8 wallet developers, with over $2,000 bug bounties.Further, we observed that 12 wallet developers have silently fixed 16 vulnerabilities after our disclosure.WALLETRADAR can effectively automate the identification of security risks in cryptocurrency wallets, thereby enhancing software development quality and safety in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
