                  <p>Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages.As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language.However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work.This has limited progress in the field.This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem.Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign.Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation.Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens.Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network.Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.</p>

                  <p>Pansharpening is a significant image fusion technique that merges the spatial content and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images to generate high-resolution multispectral images.Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA).In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition.Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion.Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches.The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method.It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The code will be made open source after possible acceptance.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality.However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects.For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves.This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts.We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts.We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark.Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass.Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction.To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering.We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering.We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices.Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures.This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality.Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Wikipedia is the largest web repository of free knowledge.Volunteer editors devote time and effort to creating and expanding articles in more than 300 language editions.As content quality varies from article to article, editors also spend substantial time rating articles with specific criteria.However, keeping these assessments complete and up-to-date is largely impossible given the ever-changing nature of Wikipedia.To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel computational framework for modeling the quality of Wikipedia articles.   State-of-the-art approaches to model Wikipedia article quality have leveraged machine learning techniques with language-specific features.In contrast, our framework is based on language-agnostic structural features extracted from the articles, a set of universal weights, and a language version-specific normalization criterion.Therefore, we ensure that all language editions of Wikipedia can benefit from our framework, even those that do not have their own quality assessment scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this framework, we have built datasets with the feature values and quality scores of all revisions of all articles in the existing language versions of Wikipedia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>We provide a descriptive analysis of these resources and a benchmark of our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we discuss possible downstream tasks to be addressed with these datasets, which are released for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress in image denoising, it is still challenging to restore fine-scale details while removing noise, especially in extremely low-light environments.Leveraging near-infrared (NIR) images to assist visible RGB image denoising shows the potential to address this issue, becoming a promising technology.Nonetheless, existing works still struggle with taking advantage of NIR information effectively for real-world image denoising, due to the content inconsistency between NIR-RGB images and the scarcity of real-world paired datasets.To alleviate the problem, we propose an efficient Selective Fusion Module (SFM), which can be plug-and-played into the advanced denoising networks to merge the deep NIR-RGB features.Specifically, we sequentially perform the global and local modulation for NIR and RGB features, and then integrate the two modulated features.Furthermore, we present a Real-world NIR-Assisted Image Denoising (Real-NAID) dataset, which covers diverse scenarios as well as various noise levels.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and our real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to understand the visual objects and their semantic relationships from one given image.Until now, lots of SGG datasets with the eyelevel view are released but the SGG dataset with the overhead view is scarcely studied.By contrast to the object occlusion problem in the eyelevel view, which impedes the SGG, the overhead view provides a new perspective that helps to promote the SGG by providing a clear perception of the spatial relationships of objects in the ground scene.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill in the gap of the overhead view dataset, this paper constructs and releases an aerial image urban scene graph generation (AUG) dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Images from the AUG dataset are captured with the low-attitude overhead view.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the AUG dataset, 25,594 objects, 16,970 relationships, and 27,175 attributes are manually annotated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>To avoid the local context being overwhelmed in the complex aerial urban scene, this paper proposes one new locality-preserving graph convolutional network (LPG).Different from the traditional graph convolutional network, which has the natural advantage of capturing the global context for SGG, the convolutional layer in the LPG integrates the non-destructive initial features of the objects with dynamically updated neighborhood information to preserve the local context under the premise of mining the global context.To address the problem that there exists an extra-large number of potential object relationship pairs but only a small part of them is meaningful in AUG, we propose the adaptive bounding box scaling factor for potential relationship detection (ABS-PRD) to intelligently prune the meaningless relationship pairs.Extensive experiments on the AUG dataset show that our LPG can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of the proposed locality-preserving strategy.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents that accomplish complex computer tasks with minimal human interventions have the potential to transform human-computer interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility and productivity.However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability.To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications.Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants.While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, environment, baseline models, and data are publicly available at https://os-world.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a category of Federated Learning in which models are trained collaboratively among parties with vertically partitioned data.Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner.Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels.These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL.In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that by applying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacks decreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of the whole VFL almost unaltered. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Stochastic learning to rank (LTR) is a recent branch in the LTR field that concerns the optimization of probabilistic ranking models.Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models.For example, they can increase the diversity of displayed documents, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balance exploitation and exploration through randomization.A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks).This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.   In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs.Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thus, through the contribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfully introduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection and localization in images is a growing field in computer vision.In this area, a seemingly understudied problem is anomaly clustering, i.e., identifying and grouping different types of anomalies in a fully unsupervised manner.In this work, we propose a novel method for clustering anomalies in largely stationary images (textures) in a blind setting.That is, the input consists of normal and anomalous images without distinction and without labels.What contributes to the difficulty of the task is that anomalous regions are often small and may present only subtle changes in appearance, which can be easily overshadowed by the genuine variance in the texture.Moreover, each anomaly type may have a complex appearance distribution.We introduce a novel scheme for solving this task using a combination of blind anomaly localization and contrastive learning.By identifying the anomalous regions with high fidelity, we can restrict our focus to those regions of interest; then, contrastive learning is employed to increase the separability of different anomaly types and reduce the intra-class variation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that the proposed solution yields significantly better results compared to prior work, setting a new state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Project page: https://reality.tf.fau.de/pub/ardelean2024blind.html.</p>

                  <p>In the food industry, assessing the quality of poultry carcasses during processing is a crucial step.This study proposes an effective approach for automating the assessment of carcass quality without requiring skilled labor or inspector involvement.The proposed system is based on machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) techniques, enabling automated defect detection and carcass quality assessment.To this end, an end-to-end framework called CarcassFormer is introduced.It is built upon a Transformer-based architecture designed to effectively extract visual representations while simultaneously detecting, segmenting, and classifying poultry carcass defects.Our proposed framework is capable of analyzing imperfections resulting from production and transport welfare issues, as well as processing plant stunner, scalder, picker, and other equipment malfunctions.To benchmark the framework, a dataset of 7,321 images was initially acquired, which contained both single and multiple carcasses per image.In this study, the performance of the CarcassFormer system is compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for both classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive quantitative experiments, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating remarkable improvements across various evaluation metrics such as AP, AP@50, and AP@75. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Furthermore, the qualitative results highlight the strengths of CarcassFormer in capturing fine details, including feathers, and accurately localizing and segmenting carcasses with high precision.To facilitate further research and collaboration, the pre-trained model and source code of CarcassFormer is available for research purposes at: \url{https://github.com/UARK-AICV/CarcassFormer}.</p>

                  <p>Stochastic video prediction enables the consideration of uncertainty in future motion, thereby providing a better reflection of the dynamic nature of the environment.Stochastic video prediction methods based on image auto-regressive recurrent models need to feed their predictions back into the latent space.Conversely, the state-space models, which decouple frame synthesis and temporal prediction, proves to be more efficient.However, inferring long-term temporal information about motion and generalizing to dynamic scenarios under non-stationary assumptions remains an unresolved challenge.In this paper, we propose a state-space decomposition stochastic video prediction model that decomposes the overall video frame generation into deterministic appearance prediction and stochastic motion prediction.Through adaptive decomposition, the model's generalization capability to dynamic scenarios is enhanced.In the context of motion prediction, obtaining a prior on the long-term trend of future motion is crucial.Thus, in the stochastic motion prediction branch, we infer the long-term motion trend from conditional frames to guide the generation of future frames that exhibit high consistency with the conditional frames.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on multiple datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine unlearning is the process of updating machine learning models to remove the information of specific training data samples, in order to comply with data protection regulations that allow individuals to request the removal of their personal data.Despite the recent development of numerous unlearning algorithms, reliable evaluation of these algorithms remains an open research question.In this work, we focus on membership inference attack (MIA) based evaluation, one of the most common approaches for evaluating unlearning algorithms, and address various pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics that lack reliability.Specifically, we propose a game-theoretic framework that formalizes the evaluation process as a game between unlearning algorithms and MIA adversaries, measuring the data removal efficacy of unlearning algorithms by the capability of the MIA adversaries.Through careful design of the game, we demonstrate that the natural evaluation metric induced from the game enjoys provable guarantees that the existing evaluation metrics fail to satisfy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose a practical and efficient algorithm to estimate the evaluation metric induced from the game, and demonstrate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This work presents a novel and reliable approach to empirically evaluating unlearning algorithms, paving the way for the development of more effective unlearning techniques.</p>

                  <p>Getting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on the downstream tasks requires pre-training over trillions of tokens.This typically demands a large number of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed training framework to accelerate the training.The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML had led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which begs the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient.AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator that has been purposely built for training large deep learning models.Its corresponding instance, Amazon EC2 trn1, is an alternative to GPU instances for LLM training.However, training LLMs with billions of parameters on trn1 is challenging due to its relatively nascent software ecosystem.In this paper, we showcase HLAT: a 7 billion parameter decoder-only LLM pre-trained using trn1 instances over 1.8 trillion tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular open source baseline models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been trained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>On various evaluation tasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines.We also share the best practice of using the Neuron Distributed Training Library (NDTL), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium to achieve efficient training.Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by the NDTL is able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase.This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the code submitted, as well as the author's and the reviewer's experience, leading to median wait times for review feedback of 15-64 hours.Through an initial user study carried with 29 experts, we found that re-ordering the files changed by a patch within the review environment has potential to improve review quality, as more comments are written (+23%), and participants' file-level hot-spot precision and recall increases to 53% (+13%) and 28% (+8%), respectively, compared to the alphanumeric ordering.Hence, this paper aims to help code reviewers by predicting which files in a submitted patch need to be (1) commented, (2) revised, or (3) are hot-spots (commented or revised).To predict these tasks, we evaluate two different types of text embeddings (i.e., Bag-of-Words and Large Language Models encoding) and review process features (i.e., code size-based and history-based features).Our empirical study on three open-source and two industrial datasets shows that combining the code embedding and review process features leads to better results than the state-of-the-art approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For all tasks, F1-scores (median of 40-62%) are significantly better than the state-of-the-art (from +1 to +9%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Regular transition systems (RTS) are a popular formalism for modeling infinite-state systems in general, and parameterised systems in particular.In a CONCUR 22 paper, Esparza et al. introduce a novel approach to the verification of RTS, based on inductive invariants.The approach computes the intersection of all inductive invariants of a given RTS that can be expressed as CNF formulas with a bounded number of clauses, and uses it to construct an automaton recognising an overapproximation of the reachable configurations.The paper shows that the problem of deciding if the language of this automaton intersects a given regular set of unsafe configurations is in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ and $\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard.   We introduce $\textit{regular abstraction frameworks}$, a generalisation of the approach of Esparza et al., very similar to the regular abstractions of Hong and Lin.A framework consists of a regular language of $\textit{constraints}$, and a transducer, called the $\textit{interpretation}$, that assigns to each constraint the set of configurations of the RTS satisfying it.Examples of regular abstraction frameworks include the formulas of Esparza et al., octagons, bounded difference matrices, and views.We show that the generalisation of the decision problem above to regular abstraction frameworks remains in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$, and prove a matching (highly non-trivial) $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness bound.   $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness implies that, in the worst case, the automaton recognising the overapproximation of the reachable configurations has a double-exponential number of states.We introduce a learning algorithm that computes this automaton in a lazy manner, stopping whenever the current hypothesis is already strong enough to prove safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report on an implementation and show that our experimental results improve on those of Esparza et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms acquire sequential behavioral patterns through interactions with the environment, their effectiveness in noisy and high-dimensional scenarios typically relies on specific structural priors.In this paper, we propose a novel and general Structural Information principles-based framework for effective Decision-Making, namely SIDM, approached from an information-theoretic perspective.This paper presents a specific unsupervised partitioning method that forms vertex communities in the state and action spaces based on their feature similarities.An aggregation function, which utilizes structural entropy as the vertex weight, is devised within each community to obtain its embedding, thereby facilitating hierarchical state and action abstractions.By extracting abstract elements from historical trajectories, a directed, weighted, homogeneous transition graph is constructed.The minimization of this graph's high-dimensional entropy leads to the generation of an optimal encoding tree.An innovative two-layer skill-based learning mechanism is introduced to compute the common path entropy of each state transition as its identified probability, thereby obviating the requirement for expert knowledge.Moreover, SIDM can be flexibly incorporated into various single-agent and multi-agent RL algorithms, enhancing their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with SOTA baselines, our framework significantly and consistently improves the policy's quality, stability, and efficiency up to 32.70%, 88.26%, and 64.86%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Studies continually find that message-passing graph convolutional networks suffer from the over-smoothing issue.Basically, the issue of over-smoothing refers to the phenomenon that the learned embeddings for all nodes can become very similar to one another and therefore are uninformative after repeatedly applying message passing iterations.Intuitively, we can expect the generated embeddings become smooth asymptotically layerwisely, that is each layer of graph convolution generates a smoothed version of embeddings as compared to that generated by the previous layer.Based on this intuition, we propose RandAlign, a stochastic regularization method for graph convolutional networks.The idea of RandAlign is to randomly align the learned embedding for each node with that of the previous layer using randomly interpolation in each graph convolution layer.Through alignment, the smoothness of the generated embeddings is explicitly reduced.To better maintain the benefit yielded by the graph convolution, in the alignment step we introduce to first scale the embedding of the previous layer to the same norm as the generated embedding and then perform random interpolation for aligning the generated embedding.RandAlign is a parameter-free method and can be directly applied without introducing additional trainable weights or hyper-parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally evaluate RandAlign on different graph domain tasks on seven benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>The experimental results show that RandAlign is a general method that improves the generalization performance of various graph convolutional network models and also improves the numerical stability of optimization, advancing the state of the art performance for graph representation learning.</p>

                  <p>Intent-driven Networks (IDNs) are crucial in enhancing network management efficiency by enabling the translation of high-level intents into executable configurations via a top-down approach.The escalating complexity of network architectures, however, has led to a semantic gap between these intents and their actual configurations, posing significant challenges to the accuracy and reliability of IDNs.While existing methodologies attempt to address this gap through a bottom-up analysis of network metadata, they often fall short, focusing primarily on intent extraction or reasoning without fully leveraging insights to tackle the inherent challenges of IDNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate this, we introduce SAFLA, a semantic-aware framework specifically designed to assure the full lifecycle of intents within IDNs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>By seamlessly integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches, SAFLA not only provides comprehensive intent assurance but also effectively bridges the semantic gap.This integration facilitates a self-healing mechanism, substantially reducing the need for manual intervention even in dynamically changing network environments.Experimental results demonstrate the framework's feasibility and efficiency, confirming its capacity to quickly adapt intents in response to network changes, thus marking an important advancement in the field of IDNs.</p>

                  <p>Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos.Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective fine-tuning of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization.Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT).However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate.To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39\%.Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including automated program repair (APR).In this study, we take a deep dive into automated bug fixing utilizing LLMs.In contrast to many deep learning-based APR methods that assume known bug locations, rely on line-level localization tools, or address bug prediction and fixing in one step, our approach uniquely employs LLMs to predict bug location at the token level and subsequently utilizes them for bug fixing.This methodological separation of bug localization and fixing using different LLMs enables effective integration of diverse contextual information and improved incorporation of inductive biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Toggle: Token-Granulated Bug Localization and Repair, a comprehensive program repair framework that integrates a bug localization model, an adjustment unit, and a bug-fixing model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Toggle takes a buggy function as input and generates a complete corrected function.We investigate various styles of prompting to the bug fixing model to identify the most effective prompts that better utilize the inductive bias and significantly outperform others.Toggle achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CodeXGLUE code refinement benchmark, and exhibits better and comparable performance on several other widely-used APR datasets, including Defects4J.</p>
