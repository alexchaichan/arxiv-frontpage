                  <p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to systems and remain undetected for extended periods.To evade detection, APT cyberattacks deceive defense layers with breaches and exploits, thereby complicating exposure by traditional anomaly detection-based security methods.The challenge of detecting APTs with machine learning is compounded by the rarity of relevant datasets and the significant imbalance in the data, which makes the detection process highly burdensome.We present AE-APT, a deep learning-based tool for APT detection that features a family of AutoEncoder methods ranging from a basic one to a Transformer-based one.We evaluated our tool on a suite of provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004% of the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>The outcomes showed that AE-APT has significantly higher detection rates compared to its competitors, indicating superior performance in detecting and ranking anomalies.</p>

                  <p>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to our interaction with digital devices.Recently, growing efforts have been made to build models for various GUI understanding tasks.However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (SPR) task.This task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the SPR task.Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree.Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements.Such layout information is crucial for accurately interpreting information on the screen, distinguishing our ToL agent from other screen reading tools.We also thoroughly evaluate the ToL agent against other baselines on a newly proposed SPR benchmark, which includes GUIs from mobile, web, and operating systems.Last but not least, we test the ToL agent on mobile GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating its utility in identifying incorrect actions along the path of agent execution trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data: screen-point-and-read.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Benchmarks that closely reflect downstream application scenarios are essential for the streamlined adoption of new research in tabular machine learning (ML).In this work, we examine existing tabular benchmarks and find two common characteristics of industry-grade tabular data that are underrepresented in the datasets available to the academic community.First, tabular data often changes over time in real-world deployment scenarios.This impacts model performance and requires time-based train and test splits for correct model evaluation.Yet, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>For each specific dataset, this can have a different impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features, which in turn can affect model selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill the aforementioned gaps in academic benchmarks, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets covering a wide range of domains from finance to food delivery services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>We assess a large number of tabular ML models in the feature-rich, temporally-evolving data setting facilitated by TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on time-based data splits leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits more common in academic benchmarks.Furthermore, on the TabReD datasets, MLP-like architectures and GBDT show the best results, while more sophisticated DL models are yet to prove their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Generating ambient sounds and effects is a challenging problem due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task.In this work, we tackle the problem by introducing two new models.First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model.We show that by leveraging metadata available with the audio modality, we can substantially improve the quality of captions.AutoCap reaches CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then use AutoCap to caption clips from existing datasets, obtaining 761,000 audio clips with high-quality captions, forming the largest available audio-text dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters and train with our new dataset.When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 15.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works.This shows that the quality of data is often as important as its quantity.Besides, since AutoCap is fully automatic, new audio samples can be added to the training dataset, unlocking the training of even larger generative models for audio synthesis.</p>

                  <p>Chart understanding plays a pivotal role when applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to real-world tasks such as analyzing scientific papers or financial reports.However, existing datasets often focus on oversimplified and homogeneous charts with template-based questions, leading to an over-optimistic measure of progress.We demonstrate that although open-source models can appear to outperform strong proprietary models on these benchmarks, a simple stress test with slightly different charts or questions can deteriorate performance by up to 34.5%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose CharXiv, a comprehensive evaluation suite involving 2,323 natural, challenging, and diverse charts from arXiv papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>CharXiv includes two types of questions: 1) descriptive questions about examining basic chart elements and 2) reasoning questions that require synthesizing information across complex visual elements in the chart.To ensure quality, all charts and questions are handpicked, curated, and verified by human experts.Our results reveal a substantial, previously underestimated gap between the reasoning skills of the strongest proprietary model (i.e., GPT-4o), which achieves 47.1% accuracy, and the strongest open-source model (i.e., InternVL Chat V1.5), which achieves 29.2%.All models lag far behind human performance of 80.5%, underscoring weaknesses in the chart understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs.We hope CharXiv facilitates future research on MLLM chart understanding by providing a more realistic and faithful measure of progress.Project page and leaderboard: https://charxiv.github.io/</p>

                  <p>We introduce MultiDiff, a novel approach for consistent novel view synthesis of scenes from a single RGB image.The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature, as there exist multiple, plausible explanations for unobserved areas.To address this issue, we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models.Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views, increasing geometric stability.The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes, allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images.In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation, MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements, while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude.For additional consistency and image quality improvements, we introduce a novel, structured noise distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate that MultiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging, real-world datasets RealEstate10K and ScanNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Finally, our model naturally supports multi-view consistent editing without the need for further tuning.</p>

                  <p>The development of Natural Language Processing (NLI) datasets and models has been inspired by innovations in annotation design.With the rapid development of machine learning models today, the performance of existing machine learning models has quickly reached state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks related to natural language processing, including natural language inference tasks.By using a pre-trained model during the annotation process, it is possible to challenge current NLI models by having humans produce premise-hypothesis combinations that the machine model cannot correctly predict.To remain attractive and challenging in the research of natural language inference for Vietnamese, in this paper, we introduce the adversarial NLI dataset to the NLP research community with the name ViANLI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This data set contains more than 10K premise-hypothesis pairs and is built by a continuously adjusting process to obtain the most out of the patterns generated by the annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>ViANLI dataset has brought many difficulties to many current SOTA models when the accuracy of the most powerful model on the test set only reached 48.4%.Additionally, the experimental results show that the models trained on our dataset have significantly improved the results on other Vietnamese NLI datasets.</p>

                  <p>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many.One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature.Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature.However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence.We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases.We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102).Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84.We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews.Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Identifying user's opinions and stances in long conversation threads on various topics can be extremely critical for enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, conflict resolution, targeted advertising, and content moderation.Hence, training language models to automate this task is critical.However, to train such models, gathering manual annotations has multiple challenges: 1) It is time-consuming and costly; 2) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing chances of noisy annotations; and 3) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly.Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we leverage Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the human annotation process on the following two tasks while also providing reasoning: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance of a post in a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which deals with labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale.The majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from these two LLMs on 764 multi-user Reddit conversations helps us curate the USDC dataset.USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models for the 5-class stance and 4-class dogmatism classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/USDC-0F7F]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language MOT is a crucial tracking problem and has drawn increasing attention recently.It aims to track objects based on human language commands, replacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks.Despite various efforts, a key challenge lies in the lack of a clear understanding of why language is used for tracking, which hinders further development in this field.In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, along with a corresponding large-scale benchmark, termed LaMOT, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions.Specially, LaMOT comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets and aims to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT.Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer.By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT.We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.</p>

                  <p>Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses.Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers.Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.   To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus.T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains.To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic anomaly detection based on visual cues holds practical significance in various domains, such as manufacturing and product quality assessment.This paper introduces a new conditional anomaly detection problem, which involves identifying anomalies in a query image by comparing it to a reference shape.To address this challenge, we have created a large dataset, BrokenChairs-180K, consisting of around 180K images, with diverse anomalies, geometries, and textures paired with 8,143 reference 3D shapes.To tackle this task, we have proposed a novel transformer-based approach that explicitly learns the correspondence between the query image and reference 3D shape via feature alignment and leverages a customized attention mechanism for anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach has been rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments, serving as a benchmark for future research in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection.Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise.However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries.Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored.To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode.Specifically, we construct the first malware summaries, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort.At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS dataset and a benign pseudocode dataset.Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary.Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting the usability, accuracy, and completeness of summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT.Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger ChatGPT3.5.</p>

                  <p>The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution.We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses.First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment.Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation.Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response.Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models?Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning.A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other.Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis.They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/thomlake/investigating-alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings.In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution.Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Ann.

Oper.Res. 2021].The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy.A similar result for $k>1$ has remained elusive.   In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality.To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</p>

                  <p>Graph condensation (GC) is an emerging technique designed to learn a significantly smaller graph that retains the essential information of the original graph.This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs.Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications such as neural architecture search and enhances our understanding of redundancy in large graphs.Despite the rapid development of GC methods, a systematic evaluation framework remains absent, which is necessary to clarify the critical designs for particular evaluative aspects.Furthermore, several meaningful questions have not been investigated, such as whether GC inherently preserves certain graph properties and offers robustness even without targeted design efforts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce GC-Bench, a comprehensive framework to evaluate recent GC methods across multiple dimensions and to generate new insights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Our experimental findings provide a deeper insights into the GC process and the characteristics of condensed graphs, guiding future efforts in enhancing performance and exploring new applications.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Emory-Melody/GraphSlim/tree/main/benchmark}.</p>

                  <p>When machine learning (ML) models are used in applications that involve humans (e.g., online recommendation, school admission, hiring, lending), the model itself may trigger changes in the distribution of targeted data it aims to predict.Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that explicitly considers such model-dependent distribution shifts when learning ML models.While significant efforts have been devoted to finding performative stable (PS) solutions in PP for system robustness, their societal implications are less explored and it is unclear whether PS solutions are aligned with social norms such as fairness.In this paper, we set out to examine the fairness property of PS solutions in performative prediction.We first show that PS solutions can incur severe polarization effects and group-wise loss disparity.Although existing fairness mechanisms commonly used in literature can help mitigate unfairness, they may fail and disrupt the stability under model-dependent distribution shifts.We thus propose novel fairness intervention mechanisms that can simultaneously achieve both stability and fairness in PP settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both theoretical analysis and experiments are provided to validate the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket.Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket.Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types.While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity.Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address this, we propose BADGER:Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement.BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins.Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV).ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor.By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model.We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods.We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</p>

                  <p>When presented with questions involving visual thinking, humans naturally switch reasoning modalities, often forming mental images or drawing visual aids.Large language models have shown promising results in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning by expressing intermediate reasoning in text as a chain of thought, yet struggle to extend this capability to answer text queries that are easily solved by visual reasoning, even with extensive multimodal pretraining.We introduce a simple method, whiteboard-of-thought prompting, to unlock the visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models across modalities.Whiteboard-of-thought prompting provides multimodal large language models with a metaphorical `whiteboard' to draw out reasoning steps as images, then returns these images back to the model for further processing.We find this can be accomplished with no demonstrations or specialized modules, instead leveraging models' existing ability to write code with libraries such as Matplotlib and Turtle.This simple approach shows state-of-the-art results on four difficult natural language tasks that involve visual and spatial reasoning.We identify multiple settings where GPT-4o using chain-of-thought fails dramatically, including more than one where it achieves $0\%$ accuracy, while whiteboard-of-thought enables up to $92\%$ accuracy in these same settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a detailed exploration of where the technique succeeds as well as its sources of error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>During software development, poor design and implementation choices can detrimentally impact software maintainability.Design smells, recurring patterns of poorly designed fragments, signify these issues.Role-stereotypes denote the generic responsibilities that classes assume in system design.Although the concepts of role-stereotypes and design smells differ, both significantly contribute to the design and maintenance of software systems.Understanding the relationship between these aspects is crucial for enhancing software maintainability, code quality, efficient code review, guided refactoring, and the design of role-specific metrics.This paper employs an exploratory approach, combining statistical analysis and unsupervised learning methods, to understand how design smells relate to role-stereotypes across desktop and mobile applications.Analyzing 11,350 classes from 30 GitHub repositories, we identified several design smells that frequently co-occur within certain role-stereotypes.Specifically, three (3) out of six (6) role-stereotypes we studied are more prone to design smells.We also examined the variation of design smells across the two ecosystems, driven by notable differences in their underlying architecture.Findings revealed that design smells are more prevalent in desktop than in mobile applications, especially within the Service Provider and Information Holder role-stereotypes.Additionally, the unsupervised learning method showed that certain pairs or groups of role-stereotypes are prone to similar types of design smells.We believe these relationships are associated with the characteristic and collaborative properties between role-stereotypes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insights from this research provide valuable guidance for software teams on implementing design smell prevention and correction mechanisms, ensuring conceptual integrity during design and maintenance phases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>The model editing problem concerns how language models should learn new facts about the world over time.While empirical research on model editing has drawn widespread attention, the conceptual foundations of model editing remain shaky -- perhaps unsurprisingly, since model editing is essentially belief revision, a storied problem in philosophy that has eluded succinct solutions for decades.Model editing nonetheless demands a solution, since we need to be able to control the knowledge within language models.With this goal in mind, this paper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and proposes a formal testbed for model editing research.We first describe 12 open problems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem, (2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the first place.Many of these challenges are extremely difficult to address, e.g. determining far-reaching consequences of edits, labeling probabilistic entailments between facts, and updating beliefs of agent simulators.Next, we introduce a semi-synthetic dataset for model editing based on Wikidata, where we can evaluate edits against labels given by an idealized Bayesian agent.This enables us to say exactly how belief revision in language models falls short of a desirable epistemic standard.We encourage further research exploring settings where such a gold standard can be compared against.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/peterbhase/LLM-belief-revision <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current universal segmentation methods demonstrate strong capabilities in pixel-level image and video understanding.However, they lack reasoning abilities and cannot be controlled via text instructions.In contrast, large vision-language multimodal models exhibit powerful vision-based conversation and reasoning capabilities but lack pixel-level understanding and have difficulty accepting visual prompts for flexible user interaction.This paper proposes OMG-LLaVA, a new and elegant framework combining powerful pixel-level vision understanding with reasoning abilities.It can accept various visual and text prompts for flexible user interaction.Specifically, we use a universal segmentation method as the visual encoder, integrating image information, perception priors, and visual prompts into visual tokens provided to the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM is responsible for understanding the user's text instructions and providing text responses and pixel-level segmentation results based on the visual information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>We propose perception prior embedding to better integrate perception priors with image features.OMG-LLaVA achieves image-level, object-level, and pixel-level reasoning and understanding in a single model, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather than using LLM to connect each specialist, our work aims at end-to-end training on one encoder, one decoder, and one LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The code and model have been released for further research.</p>
