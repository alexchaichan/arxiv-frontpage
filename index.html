                  <p>Adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (ARAG) aims to dynamically determine the necessity of retrieval for queries instead of retrieving indiscriminately to enhance the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information.However, previous works largely overlook the evaluation of ARAG approaches, leading to their effectiveness being understudied.This work presents a benchmark, RetrievalQA, comprising 1,271 short-form questions covering new world and long-tail knowledge.The knowledge necessary to answer the questions is absent from LLMs; therefore, external information must be retrieved to answer correctly.This makes RetrievalQA a suitable testbed to evaluate existing ARAG methods.We observe that calibration-based methods heavily rely on threshold tuning, while vanilla prompting is inadequate for guiding LLMs to make reliable retrieval decisions.Based on our findings, we propose Time-Aware Adaptive Retrieval (TA-ARE), a simple yet effective method that helps LLMs assess the necessity of retrieval without calibration or additional training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be available at \url{https://github.com/hyintell/RetrievalQA} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of denoising hand-object interactions (HOI).Given an erroneous interaction sequence, the objective is to refine the incorrect hand trajectory to remove interaction artifacts for a perceptually realistic sequence.This challenge involves intricate interaction noise, including unnatural hand poses and incorrect hand-object relations, alongside the necessity for robust generalization to new interactions and diverse noise patterns.We tackle those challenges through a novel approach, GeneOH Diffusion, incorporating two key designs: an innovative contact-centric HOI representation named GeneOH and a new domain-generalizable denoising scheme.The contact-centric representation GeneOH informatively parameterizes the HOI process, facilitating enhanced generalization across various HOI scenarios.The new denoising scheme consists of a canonical denoising model trained to project noisy data samples from a whitened noise space to a clean data manifold and a "denoising via diffusion" strategy which can handle input trajectories with various noise patterns by first diffusing them to align with the whitened noise space and cleaning via the canonical denoiser.Extensive experiments on four benchmarks with significant domain variations demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method.GeneOH Diffusion also shows promise for various downstream applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>https://meowuu7.github.io/GeneOH-Diffusion/.</p>

                  <p>Multi-modal fusion is vital to the success of super-resolution of depth images.However, commonly used fusion strategies, such as addition and concatenation, fall short of effectively bridging the modal gap.As a result, guided image filtering methods have been introduced to mitigate this issue.Nevertheless, it is observed that their filter kernels usually encounter significant texture interference and edge inaccuracy.To tackle these two challenges, we introduce a Scene Prior Filtering network, SPFNet, which utilizes the priors surface normal and semantic map from large-scale models.Specifically, we design an All-in-one Prior Propagation that computes the similarity between multi-modal scene priors, \textit{i.e.}, RGB, normal, semantic, and depth, to reduce the texture interference.In addition, we present a One-to-one Prior Embedding that continuously embeds each single-modal prior into depth using Mutual Guided Filtering, further alleviating the texture interference while enhancing edges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our SPFNet has been extensively evaluated on both real and synthetic datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>Auto-regressive models have achieved impressive results in 2D image generation by modeling joint distributions in grid space.In this paper, we extend auto-regressive models to 3D domains, and seek a stronger ability of 3D shape generation by improving auto-regressive models at capacity and scalability simultaneously.Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly available 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It consists of a comprehensive collection of approximately 900,000 objects, with multiple properties of meshes, points, voxels, rendered images, and text captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>This diverse labeled dataset, termed Objaverse-Mix, empowers our model to learn from a wide range of object variations.However, directly applying 3D auto-regression encounters critical challenges of high computational demands on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions, resulting in inferior quality of 3D shapes.To this end, we then present a novel framework Argus3D in terms of capacity.Concretely, our approach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions in a more tractable order.The capacity of conditional generation can thus be realized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent vector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts.In addition, thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our approach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further enhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation.Extensive experiments on four generation tasks demonstrate that Argus3D can synthesize diverse and faithful shapes across multiple categories, achieving remarkable performance.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational context.Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships.However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic.This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities.The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le\'on, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020.The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data.The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures.The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection.The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection.The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network.Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>Food computing brings various perspectives to computer vision like vision-based food analysis for nutrition and health.As a fundamental task in food computing, food detection needs Zero-Shot Detection (ZSD) on novel unseen food objects to support real-world scenarios, such as intelligent kitchens and smart restaurants.Therefore, we first benchmark the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) by introducing FOWA dataset with rich attribute annotations.Unlike ZSD, fine-grained problems in ZSFD like inter-class similarity make synthesized features inseparable.The complexity of food semantic attributes further makes it more difficult for current ZSD methods to distinguish various food categories.To address these problems, we propose a novel framework ZSFDet to tackle fine-grained problems by exploiting the interaction between complex attributes.Specifically, we model the correlation between food categories and attributes in ZSFDet by multi-source graphs to provide prior knowledge for distinguishing fine-grained features.Within ZSFDet, Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) learns knowledge representation from multiple sources (e.g., ingredients correlation from knowledge graph) via the multi-source graph fusion.Conditioned on the fusion of semantic knowledge representation, the region feature diffusion model in KEFS can generate fine-grained features for training the effective zero-shot detector.Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method ZSFDet on FOWA and the widely-used food dataset UECFOOD-256, with significant improvements by 1.8% and 3.7% ZSD mAP compared with the strong baseline RRFS.Further experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO prove that enhancement of the semantic knowledge can also improve the performance on general ZSD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/KEFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes.Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts.This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images.Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models.Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics.The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice.The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</p>

This facilitates the generation of an image close to a clean image, enabling robust generation.Furthermore, we propose a class-wise noise schedule to differentially diffuse the labels depending on the class.We demonstrate that the proposed method generates high-quality samples through extensive experiments and analyses on benchmark datasets, including a novel experimental setup simulating human errors during real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution.For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets.To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference.Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks.It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches.Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment.We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts.Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes.We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts.We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Should prediction models always deliver a prediction?In the pursuit of maximum predictive performance, critical considerations of reliability and fairness are often overshadowed, particularly when it comes to the role of uncertainty.Selective regression, also known as the "reject option," allows models to abstain from predictions in cases of considerable uncertainty.Initially proposed seven decades ago, approaches to selective regression have mostly focused on distribution-based proxies for measuring uncertainty, particularly conditional variance.However, this focus neglects the significant influence of model-specific biases on a model's performance.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to selective regression by leveraging conformal prediction, which provides grounded confidence measures for individual predictions based on model-specific biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose a standardized evaluation framework to allow proper comparison of selective regression approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Via an extensive experimental approach, we demonstrate how our proposed approach, conformalized selective regression, demonstrates an advantage over multiple state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Bit-vectors, which are integers in a finite number of bits, are ubiquitous in software and hardware systems.In this work, we consider the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) of bit-vectors.Unlike normal integers, the arithmetics of bit-vectors are modular upon integer overflow.Therefore, the SMT solving of bit-vectors needs to resolve the underlying modular arithmetics.In the literature, two prominent approaches for SMT solving are bit-blasting (that transforms the SMT problem into boolean satisfiability) and integer solving (that transforms the SMT problem into integer properties).Both approaches ignore the algebraic properties of the modular arithmetics and hence could not utilize these properties to improve the efficiency of SMT solving.   In this work, we consider the equational theory of bit-vectors and capture the algebraic properties behind them via strong Gr\"obner bases.First, we apply strong Gr\"obner bases to the quantifier-free equational theory of bit-vectors and propose a novel algorithmic improvement in the key computation of multiplicative inverse modulo a power of two.Second, we resolve the important case of invariant generation in quantified equational bit-vector properties via strong Gr\"obner bases and linear congruence solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results over an extensive range of benchmarks show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both time efficiency and memory consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficient beam training is the key challenge in the codebook-based configuration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) because the beam training overhead can have a strong impact on the achievable system performance.In this paper, we study the performance tradeoff between overhead and achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in RIS beam training while taking into account the size of the targeted coverage area, the RIS response time, and the delay for feedback transmissions.Thereby, we consider three common beam training strategies: full search (FS), hierarchical search (HS), and tracking-based search (TS).Our analysis shows that the codebook-based illumination of a given coverage area can be realized with wide- or narrow-beam designs, which result in two different scaling laws for the achievable SNR.Similarly, there are two regimes for the overhead, where the number of pilot symbols required for reliable beam training is dependent on and independent of the SNR, respectively.Based on these insights, we investigate the impact of the beam training overhead on the effective rate and provide an upper bound on the user velocity for which the overhead is negligible.Moreover, when the overhead is not negligible, we show that TS beam training achieves higher effective rates than HS and FS beam training, while HS beam training may or may not outperform FS beam training, depending on the RIS response time, feedback delay, and codebook size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we present numerical simulation results that verify our theoretical analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>In particular, our results confirm the existence of the proposed regimes, reveal that fast RISs can lead to negligible overhead for FS beam training, and show that large feedback delays can significantly reduce the performance for HS beam training.</p>

                  <p>Semantic image synthesis (SIS) is a task to generate realistic images corresponding to semantic maps (labels).It can be applied to diverse real-world practices such as photo editing or content creation.However, in real-world applications, SIS often encounters noisy user inputs.To address this, we propose Stochastic Conditional Diffusion Model (SCDM), which is a robust conditional diffusion model that features novel forward and generation processes tailored for SIS with noisy labels.It enhances robustness by stochastically perturbing the semantic label maps through Label Diffusion, which diffuses the labels with discrete diffusion.Through the diffusion of labels, the noisy and clean semantic maps become similar as the timestep increases, eventually becoming identical at $t=T$. This facilitates the generation of an image close to a clean image, enabling robust generation.Furthermore, we propose a class-wise noise schedule to differentially diffuse the labels depending on the class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that the proposed method generates high-quality samples through extensive experiments and analyses on benchmark datasets, including a novel experimental setup simulating human errors during real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting important objects of interest from images, enabling various applications.While existing methods have shown success in segmenting clean images, they often struggle to produce accurate segmentation results when dealing with degraded images, such as those containing noise or occlusions.To address this challenge, interactive segmentation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to provide meaningful input to guide the segmentation process.However, an important problem in interactive segmentation lies in determining how to incorporate minimal yet meaningful user guidance into the segmentation model.In this paper, we propose the quasi-conformal interactive segmentation (QIS) model, which incorporates user input in the form of positive and negative clicks.Users mark a few pixels belonging to the object region as positive clicks, indicating that the segmentation model should include a region around these clicks.Conversely, negative clicks are provided on pixels belonging to the background, instructing the model to exclude the region near these clicks from the segmentation mask.Additionally, the segmentation mask is obtained by deforming a template mask with the same topology as the object of interest using an orientation-preserving quasiconformal mapping.This approach helps to avoid topological errors in the segmentation results.We provide a thorough analysis of the proposed model, including theoretical support for the ability of QIS to include or exclude regions of interest or disinterest based on the user's indication.To evaluate the performance of QIS, we conduct experiments on synthesized images, medical images, natural images and noisy natural images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised visual recognition using inexact supervision is a critical yet challenging learning problem.It significantly reduces human labeling costs and traditionally relies on multi-instance learning and pseudo-labeling.This paper introduces WeakSAM and solves the weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) and segmentation by utilizing the pre-learned world knowledge contained in a vision foundation model, i.e., the Segment Anything Model (SAM).WeakSAM addresses two critical limitations in traditional WSOD retraining, i.e., pseudo ground truth (PGT) incompleteness and noisy PGT instances, through adaptive PGT generation and Region of Interest (RoI) drop regularization.It also addresses the SAM's problems of requiring prompts and category unawareness for automatic object detection and segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that WeakSAM significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in WSOD and WSIS benchmarks with large margins, i.e. average improvements of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/WeakSAM}.</p>

This work addresses the computation of the minimum triangle edge transversal in distributed networks.We show with a simple warm-up construction that this is a global task, requiring $\Omega(D)$ rounds even in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model with unbounded messages, where $D$ is the diameter of the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we show that approximating this value can be done much faster. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>A $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation can be obtained in $\text{poly}\log{n}$ rounds, where $n$ is the size of the network graph.Moreover, faster approximations can be obtained, at the cost of increasing the approximation factor to roughly 3, by a reduction to the minimum hypergraph vertex cover problem.With a time overhead of the maximum degree $\Delta$, this can also be applied to the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model, in which messages are bounded.   Our key technical contribution is proving that computing an exact solution is ``as hard as it gets'' in $\mathsf{CONGEST}$, requiring a near-quadratic number of rounds.Because this problem is an edge selection problem, as opposed to previous lower bounds that were for node selection problems, major challenges arise in constructing the lower bound, requiring us to develop novel ingredients.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for learning from distributed data while maintaining privacy.The development of efficient FL algorithms encounters various challenges, including heterogeneous data and systems, limited communication capacities, and constrained local computational resources.Recently developed FedADMM methods show great resilience to both data and system heterogeneity.However, they still suffer from performance deterioration if the hyperparameters are not carefully tuned.To address this issue, we propose an inexact and self-adaptive FedADMM algorithm, termed FedADMM-InSa.First, we design an inexactness criterion for the clients' local updates to eliminate the need for empirically setting the local training accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This inexactness criterion can be assessed by each client independently based on its unique condition, thereby reducing the local computational cost and mitigating the undesirable straggle effect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>The convergence of the resulting inexact ADMM is proved under the assumption of strongly convex loss functions.Additionally, we present a self-adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts each client's penalty parameter, enhancing algorithm robustness by mitigating the need for empirical penalty parameter choices for each client.Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted.As validated by some numerical tests, our proposed algorithm can reduce the clients' local computational load significantly and also accelerate the learning process compared to the vanilla FedADMM.</p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity.</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, and alignment.Using pairs of preferred and dispreferred data, DPO models the \textit{relative} probability of picking one response over another.In this work, first we show theoretically that the standard DPO loss can lead to a \textit{reduction} of the model's likelihood of the preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between the preferred and dispreferred classes increases.We then show empirically that this phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especially datasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low.Using these insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and training procedure which avoids this failure mode.Surprisingly, we also find that DPOP significantly outperforms DPO across a wide variety of datasets and downstream tasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions.By fine-tuning with DPOP, we create and release Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, which achieve state-of-the-art open-source performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, Smaug-72B is nearly 2\% better than any other open-source model on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and becomes the first open-source LLM to surpass an average accuracy of 80\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>
