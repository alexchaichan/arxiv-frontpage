                  <p>Maritime surveillance is vital to mitigate illegal activities such as drug smuggling, illegal fishing, and human trafficking.Vision-based maritime surveillance is challenging mainly due to visibility issues at night, which results in failures in re-identifying vessels and detecting suspicious activities.In this paper, we introduce a thermal, vision-based approach for maritime surveillance with object tracking, vessel re-identification, and suspicious activity detection capabilities.For vessel re-identification, we propose a novel viewpoint-independent algorithm which compares features of the sides of the vessel separately (separate side-spaces) leveraging shape information in the absence of color features.We propose techniques to adapt tracking and activity detection algorithms for the thermal domain and train them using a thermal dataset we created.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset will be the first publicly available benchmark dataset for thermal maritime surveillance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Our system is capable of re-identifying vessels with an 81.8% Top1 score and identifying suspicious activities with a 72.4\% frame mAP score; a new benchmark for each task in the thermal domain.</p>

                  <p>High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs).Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI.High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets.Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM?We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie.Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature.We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K high-quality instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>To compare Magpie data with other public instruction datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models.Our results indicate that in some tasks, models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning.We also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback.This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench.</p>

                  <p>Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict four aspect-based elements, including aspect term, opinion term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity.In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model.Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications.Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study.Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence.However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates.To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broadview Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates.Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen-Shannon divergence.BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates.Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism.Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/byinhao/BvSP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper we present results from a qualitative field study on explainable AI (XAI) for lay users (n = 18) who were subjected to AI cyberattacks.The study was based on a custom-built smart heating application called Squid and was conducted over seven weeks in early 2023.Squid combined a smart radiator valve installed in participant homes with a web application that implemented an AI feature known as setpoint learning, which is commonly available in consumer smart thermostats.Development of Squid followed the XAI principle of interpretability-by-design where the AI feature was implemented using a simple glass-box machine learning model with the model subsequently exposed to users via the web interface (e.g. as interactive visualisations).AI attacks on users were simulated by injecting malicious training data and by manipulating data used for model predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Research data consisted of semi-structured interviews, researcher field notes, participant diaries, and application logs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>In our analysis we reflect on the impact of XAI on user satisfaction and user comprehension as well as its use as a tool for diagnosing AI attacks.Our results show only limited engagement with XAI features and suggest that, for Squid users, common assumptions found in the XAI literature were not aligned to reality.On the positive side, users appear to have developed better mental models of the AI feature compared to previous work, and there is evidence that users did make some use of XAI as a diagnostic tool.</p>

                  <p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are indispensable for perception tasks of autonomous vehicles, thanks to their resilience in challenging weather conditions.Yet, their deployment is often limited by insufficient spatial resolution for precise semantic scene interpretation.Classical super-resolution techniques adapted from optical imaging inadequately address the distinct characteristics of radar signal data.In response, our study redefines radar imaging super-resolution as a one-dimensional (1D) signal super-resolution spectra estimation problem by harnessing the radar signal processing domain knowledge, introducing innovative data normalization and a domain-informed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-guided loss function.Our tailored deep learning network for automotive radar imaging exhibits remarkable scalability, parameter efficiency and fast inference speed, alongside enhanced performance in terms of radar imaging quality and resolution.Extensive testing confirms that our SR-SPECNet sets a new benchmark in producing high-resolution radar range-azimuth images, outperforming existing methods across varied antenna configurations and dataset sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code and new radar dataset will be made publicly available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span></p>

                  <p>Surgical scene perception via videos are critical for advancing robotic surgery, telesurgery, and AI-assisted surgery, particularly in ophthalmology.However, the scarcity of diverse and richly annotated video datasets has hindered the development of intelligent systems for surgical workflow analysis.Existing datasets for surgical workflow analysis, which typically face challenges such as small scale, a lack of diversity in surgery and phase categories, and the absence of time-localized annotations, limit the requirements for action understanding and model generalization validation in complex and diverse real-world surgical scenarios.To address this gap, we introduce OphNet, a large-scale, expert-annotated video benchmark for ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.OphNet features: 1) A diverse collection of 2,278 surgical videos spanning 66 types of cataract, glaucoma, and corneal surgeries, with detailed annotations for 102 unique surgical phases and 150 granular operations; 2) It offers sequential and hierarchical annotations for each surgery, phase, and operation, enabling comprehensive understanding and improved interpretability; 3) Moreover, OphNet provides time-localized annotations, facilitating temporal localization and prediction tasks within surgical workflows.With approximately 205 hours of surgical videos, OphNet is about 20 times larger than the largest existing surgical workflow analysis benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code have been made available at: \url{https://github.com/minghu0830/OphNet-benchmark}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

Given two adversarial text prompts containing an identical set of action words with minor differences, such as "a lightbulb without electricity" v.s. "a lightbulb with electricity", we evaluate whether T2I models can conduct visual-commonsense reasoning, e.g. produce images that fit "the lightbulb is unlit" vs. "the lightbulb is lit" correspondingly.Commonsense-T2I presents an adversarial challenge, providing pairwise text prompts along with expected outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is carefully hand-curated by experts and annotated with fine-grained labels, such as commonsense type and likelihood of the expected outputs, to assist analyzing model behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art (sota) T2I models and surprisingly find that, there is still a large gap between image synthesis and real life photos--even the DALL-E 3 model could only achieve 48.92% on Commonsense-T2I, and the stable diffusion XL model only achieves 24.92% accuracy.Our experiments show that GPT-enriched prompts cannot solve this challenge, and we include a detailed analysis about possible reasons for such deficiency.We aim for Commonsense-T2I to serve as a high-quality evaluation benchmark for T2I commonsense checking, fostering advancements in real life image generation.</p>

                  <p>Modern alignment techniques based on human preferences, such as RLHF and DPO, typically employ divergence regularization relative to the reference model to ensure training stability.However, this often limits the flexibility of models during alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancy between the preference data and the reference model.In this paper, we focus on the alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed a significant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature of visual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect can easily induce such a discrepancy.Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel and memory-friendly preference alignment method for diffusion models that does not depend on any reference model, coined margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO).MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between the preferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets, simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences.For evaluation, we introduce two new pairwise preference datasets, which comprise self-generated image pairs from SDXL, Pick-Style and Pick-Safety, simulating diverse scenarios of reference mismatch.Our experiments validate that MaPO can significantly improve alignment on Pick-Style and Pick-Safety and general preference alignment when used with Pick-a-Pic v2, surpassing the base SDXL and other existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, models, and datasets are publicly available via https://mapo-t2i.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce a new generative approach for synthesizing 3D geometry and images from single-view collections.Most existing approaches predict volumetric density to render multi-view consistent images.By employing volumetric rendering using neural radiance fields, they inherit a key limitation: the generated geometry is noisy and unconstrained, limiting the quality and utility of the output meshes.To address this issue, we propose GeoGen, a new SDF-based 3D generative model trained in an end-to-end manner.Initially, we reinterpret the volumetric density as a Signed Distance Function (SDF).This allows us to introduce useful priors to generate valid meshes.However, those priors prevent the generative model from learning details, limiting the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios.To alleviate that problem, we make the transformation learnable and constrain the rendered depth map to be consistent with the zero-level set of the SDF.Through the lens of adversarial training, we encourage the network to produce higher fidelity details on the output meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset of human avatars captured from 360-degree camera angles, to overcome the challenges presented by real-world datasets, which often lack 3D consistency and do not cover all camera angles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our experiments on multiple datasets show that GeoGen produces visually and quantitatively better geometry than the previous generative models based on neural radiance fields.</p>

                  <p>Conversational tones -- the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate -- are essential to effective communication.Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models (LLMs) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans.However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains.Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and GPT-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones.With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4.This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.</p>

                  <p>Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments.However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers.As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning.To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between.We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution.The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system.First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset.Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/AD-H</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves.We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages.This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process.In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level.Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts.The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens.Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB.Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit strong potential in node classification task through a message-passing mechanism.However, their performance often hinges on high-quality node labels, which are challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios due to unreliable sources or adversarial attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, label noise is common in real-world graph data, negatively impacting GNNs by propagating incorrect information during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>To address this issue, the study of Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise (GLN) has recently gained traction.However, due to variations in dataset selection, data splitting, and preprocessing techniques, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark, which impedes deeper understanding and further development of GLN.To fill this gap, we introduce NoisyGL in this paper, the first comprehensive benchmark for graph neural networks under label noise.NoisyGL enables fair comparisons and detailed analyses of GLN methods on noisy labeled graph data across various datasets, with unified experimental settings and interface.Our benchmark has uncovered several important insights that were missed in previous research, and we believe these findings will be highly beneficial for future studies.We hope our open-source benchmark library will foster further advancements in this field.The code of the benchmark can be found in https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/NoisyGL.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces an algorithmic solution to a broader class of unlabeled sensing problems with multiple measurement vectors (MMV).The goal is to recover an unknown structured signal matrix, $\mathbf{X}$, from its noisy linear observation matrix, $\mathbf{Y}$, whose rows are further randomly shuffled by an unknown permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. A new Bayes-optimal unlabeled compressed sensing (UCS) recovery algorithm is developed from the bilinear approximate message passing (Bi-VAMP) framework using non-separable and coupled priors on the rows and columns of the permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. In particular, standard unlabeled sensing is a special case of the proposed framework, and UCS further generalizes it by neither assuming a partially shuffled signal matrix $\mathbf{X}$ nor a small-sized permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. For the sake of theoretical performance prediction, we also conduct a state evolution (SE) analysis of the proposed algorithm and show its consistency with the asymptotic empirical mean-squared error (MSE).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UCS algorithm and its advantage over state-of-the-art baseline approaches in various applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>We also numerically examine the phase transition diagrams of UCS, thereby characterizing the detectability region as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</p>

                  <p>Foundation Models (FMs) serve as a general class for the development of artificial intelligence systems, offering broad potential for generalization across a spectrum of downstream tasks.Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization.The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear.2) Scalability.It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets.3) Efficiency.The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation.4) Training Stop Criteria.Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks.To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models.Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering.For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies.Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput.Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tabular synthesis models remain ineffective at capturing complex dependencies, and the quality of synthetic data is still insufficient for comprehensive downstream tasks, such as prediction under distribution shifts, automated decision-making, and cross-table understanding.A major challenge is the lack of prior knowledge about underlying structures and high-order relationships in tabular data.We argue that a systematic evaluation on high-order structural information for tabular data synthesis is the first step towards solving the problem.In this paper, we introduce high-order structural causal information as natural prior knowledge and provide a benchmark framework for the evaluation of tabular synthesis models.The framework allows us to generate benchmark datasets with a flexible range of data generation processes and to train tabular synthesis models using these datasets for further evaluation.We propose multiple benchmark tasks, high-order metrics, and causal inference tasks as downstream tasks for evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by the trained models.Our experiments demonstrate to leverage the benchmark framework for evaluating the model capability of capturing high-order structural causal information.Furthermore, our benchmarking results provide an initial assessment of state-of-the-art tabular synthesis models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They have clearly revealed significant gaps between ideal and actual performance and how baseline methods differ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark framework is available at URL https://github.com/TURuibo/CauTabBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph partitioning (GP) and vertex connectivity have traditionally been two distinct fields of study.This paper introduces the highly connected graph partitioning (HCGP) problem, which partitions a graph into compact, size balanced, and $Q$-(vertex) connected parts for any $Q\geq 1$.This problem is valuable in applications that seek cohesion and fault-tolerance within their parts, such as community detection in social networks and resiliency-focused partitioning of power networks.Existing research in this fundamental interconnection primarily focuses on providing theoretical existence guarantees of highly connected partitions for a limited set of dense graphs, and do not include canonical GP considerations such as size balance and compactness.This paper's key contribution is providing a general modeling and algorithmic approach for HCGP, inspired by recent work in the political districting problem, a special case of HCGP with $Q=1$. This approach models $Q$-connectivity constraints as mixed integer programs for any $Q\geq 1$ and provides an efficient branch-and-cut method to solve HCGP.When solution time is a priority over optimality, this paper provides a heuristic method specifically designed for HCGP with $Q=2$. A computational analysis evaluates these methods using a test bed of instances from various real-world graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this analysis, the branch-and-cut method finds an optimal solution within one hour in $82.8\%$ of the instances solved. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>For $Q=2$, small and sparse instances are challenging for the heuristic, whereas large and sparse instances are challenging for the exact method.Furthermore, this study quantifies the computational cost of ensuring higher connectivity using the branch-and-cut approach, compared to a baseline of ensuring $1$-connectivity.Overall, this work serves as an effective tool to partition a graph into resilient and cohesive parts.</p>

                  <p>High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs).Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI.High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets.Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM?We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie.Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature.We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses.We perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K high-quality instances.To compare Magpie data with other public instruction datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models.Our results indicate that in some tasks, models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning.We also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Many machine learning tasks, such as principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion, give rise to manifold optimization problems.Although there is a large body of work studying the design and analysis of algorithms for manifold optimization in the centralized setting, there are currently very few works addressing the federated setting.In this paper, we consider nonconvex federated learning over a compact smooth submanifold in the setting of heterogeneous client data.We propose an algorithm that leverages stochastic Riemannian gradients and a manifold projection operator to improve computational efficiency, uses local updates to improve communication efficiency, and avoids client drift.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretically, we show that our proposed algorithm converges sub-linearly to a neighborhood of a first-order optimal solution by using a novel analysis that jointly exploits the manifold structure and properties of the loss functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has significantly smaller computational and communication overhead than existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>Higher-order graph clustering aims to partition the graph using frequently occurring subgraphs.Motif conductance is one of the most promising higher-order graph clustering models due to its strong interpretability.However, existing motif conductance based graph clustering algorithms are mainly limited by a seminal two-stage reweighting computing framework, needing to enumerate all motif instances to obtain an edge-weighted graph for partitioning.However, such a framework has two-fold vital defects: (1) It can only provide a quadratic bound for the motif with three vertices, and whether there is provable clustering quality for other motifs is still an open question.(2) The enumeration procedure of motif instances incurs prohibitively high costs against large motifs or large dense graphs due to combinatorial explosions.Besides, expensive spectral clustering or local graph diffusion on the edge-weighted graph also makes existing methods unable to handle massive graphs with millions of nodes.To overcome these dilemmas, we propose a Provable and Scalable Motif Conductance algorithm PSMC, which has a fixed and motif-independent approximation ratio for any motif.Specifically, PSMC first defines a new vertex metric Motif Resident based on the given motif, which can be computed locally.Then, it iteratively deletes the vertex with the smallest motif resident value very efficiently using novel dynamic update technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, it outputs the locally optimal result during the above iterative process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>To further boost efficiency, we propose several effective bounds to estimate the motif resident value of each vertex, which can greatly reduce computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve 3.2-32 times speedup and improve the quality by at least 12 times than the baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

Off-the-shelf methods, such as DP-GD, require strong a priori knowledge locating the data within a ball of radius $R$, and the excess risk of the algorithm depends linearly on $R$. In this paper, we ask: can we design an efficient and private algorithm with an excess error guarantee that scales with the (unknown) radius containing the majority of the datapoints?Our main contribution is a pair of polynomial-time DP algorithms for the task of private GM with an excess error guarantee that scales with the effective diameter of the datapoints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose an inefficient algorithm based on the inverse smooth sensitivity mechanism, which satisfies the more restrictive notion of pure DP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We complement our results with a lower bound and demonstrate the optimality of our polynomial-time algorithms in terms of sample complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Exploring proper way to conduct multi-speech feature fusion for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition is crucial as different speech features could provide complementary cues reflecting human emotion status.While most previous approaches only extract a single speech feature for emotion recognition, existing fusion methods such as concatenation, parallel connection, and splicing ignore heterogeneous patterns in the interaction between features and features, resulting in performance of existing systems.In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fusion method to explicitly model the relationships between every pair of speech features.Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional edge features learning strategy called Graph-based multi-Feature fusion method for speech emotion recognition.It represents each speech feature as a node and learns multi-dimensional edge features to explicitly describe the relationship between each feature-feature pair in the context of emotion recognition.This way, the learned multi-dimensional edge features encode speech feature-level information from both the vertex and edge dimensions.Our Approach consists of three modules: an Audio Feature Generation(AFG)module, an Audio-Feature Multi-dimensional Edge Feature(AMEF) module and a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) module.The proposed methodology yielded satisfactory outcomes on the SEWA dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the method demonstrated enhanced performance compared to the baseline in the AVEC 2019 Workshop and Challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>We used data from two cultures as our training and validation sets: two cultures containing German and Hungarian on the SEWA dataset, the CCC scores for German are improved by 17.28% for arousal and 7.93% for liking.The outcomes of our methodology demonstrate a 13% improvement over alternative fusion techniques, including those employing one dimensional edge-based feature fusion approach.</p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language models (LLMs).Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length.Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''.The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly.This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs.To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues.However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths.This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions.Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Image editing serves as a practical yet challenging task considering the diverse demands from users, where one of the hardest parts is to precisely describe how the edited image should look like.In this work, we present a new form of editing, termed imitative editing, to help users exercise their creativity more conveniently.Concretely, to edit an image region of interest, users are free to directly draw inspiration from some in-the-wild references (e.g., some relative pictures come across online), without having to cope with the fit between the reference and the source.Such a design requires the system to automatically figure out what to expect from the reference to perform the editing.For this purpose, we propose a generative training framework, dubbed MimicBrush, which randomly selects two frames from a video clip, masks some regions of one frame, and learns to recover the masked regions using the information from the other frame.That way, our model, developed from a diffusion prior, is able to capture the semantic correspondence between separate images in a self-supervised manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally show the effectiveness of our method under various test cases as well as its superiority over existing alternatives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also construct a benchmark to facilitate further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), induced by diabetes, poses a significant risk of visual impairment.Accurate and effective grading of DR aids in the treatment of this condition.Yet existing models experience notable performance degradation on unseen domains due to domain shifts.Previous methods address this issue by simulating domain style through simple visual transformation and mitigating domain noise via learning robust representations.However, domain shifts encompass more than image styles.They overlook biases caused by implicit factors such as ethnicity, age, and diagnostic criteria.In our work, we propose a novel framework where representations of paired data from different domains are decoupled into semantic features and domain noise.The resulting augmented representation comprises original retinal semantics and domain noise from other domains, aiming to generate enhanced representations aligned with real-world clinical needs, incorporating rich information from diverse domains.Subsequently, to improve the robustness of the decoupled representations, class and domain prototypes are employed to interpolate the disentangled representations while data-aware weights are designed to focus on rare classes and domains.Finally, we devise a robust pixel-level semantic alignment loss to align retinal semantics decoupled from features, maintaining a balance between intra-class diversity and dense class features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on unseen domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The code implementations are accessible on https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/DECO.</p>

                  <p>Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) methods are an important family of optimisers for deep learning models, which use approximate Fisher information matrices to pre-condition gradients during training.The empirical Fisher (EF) method approximates the Fisher information matrix empirically by reusing the per-sample gradients collected during back-propagation.Despite its ease of implementation, the EF approximation has its theoretical and practical limitations.This paper first investigates the inversely-scaled projection issue of EF, which is shown to be a major cause of the poor empirical approximation quality.An improved empirical Fisher (iEF) method, motivated as a generalised NGD method from a loss reduction perspective, is proposed to address this issue, meanwhile retaining the practical convenience of EF.The exact iEF and EF methods are experimentally evaluated using practical deep learning setups, including widely-used setups for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models (T5-base with LoRA and Prompt-Tuning on GLUE tasks, and ViT with LoRA for CIFAR100).Optimisation experiments show that applying exact iEF as an optimiser provides strong convergence and generalisation.It achieves the best test performance and the lowest training loss for majority of the tasks, even when compared with well-tuned AdamW/Adafactor baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, under a novel empirical evaluation framework, the proposed iEF method shows consistently better approximation quality to the exact Natural Gradient updates than both EF and the more expensive sampled Fisher (SF). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Further investigation also shows that the superior approximation quality of iEF is robust to damping across tasks and training stages.Improving existing approximate NGD optimisers with iEF is expected to lead to better convergence ability and stronger robustness to choice of damping.</p>

                  <p>Scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods are a family of visual localization methods that directly regress 2D-3D matches for camera pose estimation.They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision.Here, the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points.The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions, etc., but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations.The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes.In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network.We propose GLACE, which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network.Specifically, we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions.Additionally, our position decoder parameterizes the output positions for large-scale scenes more effectively.Without using 3D models or depth maps for supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale scenes with a low-map-size model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On Cambridge landmarks, with a single model, we achieve 17% lower median position error than Poker, the ensemble variant of the state-of-the-art SCR method ACE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/glace.</p>

(2021).Essentially, to start from the pretrained model as initialization for finetuning, one can either initialize B to zero and A to random (default initialization in PEFT package), or vice-versa.In both cases, the product BA is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model.These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar.They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate.We demonstrate that this is an incorrect intuition and that the first scheme (initializing B to zero and A to random) on average yields better performance compared to the other scheme.Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our results with extensive experiments on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>
