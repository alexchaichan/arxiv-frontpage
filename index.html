                  <p>Cancelable Biometric is a challenging research field in which security of an original biometric image is ensured by transforming the original biometric into another irreversible domain.Several approaches have been suggested in literature for generating cancelable biometric templates.In this paper, two novel and simple cancelable biometric template generation methods based on Random Walk (CBRW) have been proposed.By employing random walk and other steps given in the proposed two algorithms viz.CBRW-BitXOR and CBRW-BitCMP, the original biometric is transformed into a cancellable template.The performance of the proposed methods is compared with other state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments have been performed on eight publicly available gray and color datasets i.e. CP (ear) (gray and color), UTIRIS (iris) (gray and color), ORL (face) (gray), IIT Delhi (iris) (gray and color), and AR (face) (color). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Performance of the generated templates is measured in terms of Correlation Coefficient (Cr), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI).By experimental results, it has been proved that proposed methods are superior than other state-of-the-art methods in qualitative as well as quantitative analysis.Furthermore, CBRW performs better on both gray as well as color images.</p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents the UniMER dataset to provide the first study on Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) towards complex real-world scenarios.The UniMER dataset consists of a large-scale training set UniMER-1M offering an unprecedented scale and diversity with one million training instances and a meticulously designed test set UniMER-Test that reflects a diverse range of formula distributions prevalent in real-world scenarios.Therefore, the UniMER dataset enables the training of a robust and high-accuracy MER model and comprehensive evaluation of model performance.Moreover, we introduce the Universal Mathematical Expression Recognition Network (UniMERNet), an innovative framework designed to enhance MER in practical scenarios.UniMERNet incorporates a Length-Aware Module to process formulas of varied lengths efficiently, thereby enabling the model to handle complex mathematical expressions with greater accuracy.In addition, UniMERNet employs our UniMER-1M data and image augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness under different noise conditions.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMERNet outperforms existing MER models, setting a new benchmark in various scenarios and ensuring superior recognition quality in real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/opendatalab/UniMERNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern.With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed?To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages.RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language.We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario.We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages.As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language.However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work.This has limited progress in the field.This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem.Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign.Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation.Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens.Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network.Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.</p>

                  <p>Pansharpening is a significant image fusion technique that merges the spatial content and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images to generate high-resolution multispectral images.Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA).In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition.Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion.Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches.The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method.It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The code will be made open source after possible acceptance.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality.However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects.For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves.This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts.We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts.We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark.Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a category of Federated Learning in which models are trained collaboratively among parties with vertically partitioned data.Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner.Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels.These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL.In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that by applying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacks decreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of the whole VFL almost unaltered. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-language models enable open-world classification of objects without the need for any retraining.While this zero-shot paradigm marks a significant advance, even today's best models exhibit skewed performance when objects are dissimilar from their typical depiction.Real world objects such as pears appear in a variety of forms -- from diced to whole, on a table or in a bowl -- yet standard VLM classifiers map all instances of a class to a \it{single vector based on the class label}.We argue that to represent this rich diversity within a class, zero-shot classification should move beyond a single vector.We propose a method to encode and account for diversity within a class using inferred attributes, still in the zero-shot setting without retraining.We find our method consistently outperforms standard zero-shot classification over a large suite of datasets encompassing hierarchies, diverse object states, and real-world geographic diversity, as well finer-grained datasets where intra-class diversity may be less prevalent.Importantly, our method is inherently interpretable, offering faithful explanations for each inference to facilitate model debugging and enhance transparency.We also find our method scales efficiently to a large number of attributes to account for diversity -- leading to more accurate predictions for atypical instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we characterize a principled trade-off between overall and worst class accuracy, which can be tuned via a hyperparameter of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>We hope this work spurs further research into the promise of zero-shot classification beyond a single class vector for capturing diversity in the world, and building transparent AI systems without compromising performance.</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a decentralized trajectory planning framework for the collision avoidance problem of multiple micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in environments with static and dynamic obstacles.The framework utilizes spatiotemporal occupancy grid maps (SOGM), which forecast the occupancy status of neighboring space in the near future, as the environment representation.Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes.Collision avoidance between communicating robots is integrated by sharing planned trajectories and projecting them onto the SOGM.The simulation results show that our method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods in dynamic environments with different numbers and shapes of obstacles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the proposed method is validated in real experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>The open-world test dataset is often mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, where the deployed models will struggle to make accurate predictions.Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model.In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs.Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection.Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges.First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure.Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs.To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOD Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD and hinges on three innovations: i)An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules; ii) A creative graph generator to construct prototypical graphs that are in line with ID but away from OOD; iii)An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets and six baselines are conducted to demonstrate our superiority. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem.However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes.Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes.To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data.In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach.SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS).Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model.3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems.Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems.As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers.One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner.We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them.When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors.This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors.We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep models trained on large amounts of data often incorporate implicit biases present during training time.If later such a bias is discovered during inference or deployment, it is often necessary to acquire new data and retrain the model.This behavior is especially problematic in critical areas such as autonomous driving or medical decision-making.In these scenarios, new data is often expensive and hard to come by.In this work, we present a method based on change penalization that takes a pre-trained model and adapts the weights to mitigate a previously detected bias.We achieve this by tuning a zero-initialized copy of a frozen pre-trained network.Our method needs very few, in extreme cases only a single, examples that contradict the bias to increase performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose an early stopping criterion to modify baselines and reduce overfitting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We evaluate our approach on a well-known bias in skin lesion classification and three other datasets from the domain shift literature.We find that our approach works especially well with very few images.Simple fine-tuning combined with our early stopping also leads to performance benefits for a larger number of tuning samples.</p>

                  <p>Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context.This paper aims to address this question.Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads.We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\%) of the attention heads are retrieval.(3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context.When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts.(5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability.We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context.Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads.These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce XFT, a simple yet powerful training scheme, by simply merging upcycled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to unleash the performance limit of instruction-tuned code Large Language Models (LLMs).While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning, XFT introduces a shared expert mechanism with a novel routing weight normalization strategy into sparse upcycling, which significantly boosts instruction tuning.After fine-tuning the upcycled MoE model, XFT introduces a learnable model merging mechanism to compile the upcycled MoE model back to a dense model, achieving upcycled MoE-level performance with only dense-model compute.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By applying XFT to a 1.3B model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM (<3B) with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>With the same data and model architecture, XFT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by 13% on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from 2% to 13% on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability.XFT is fully orthogonal to existing techniques such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-Instruct, opening a new dimension for improving code instruction tuning.Codes are available at https://github.com/ise-uiuc/xft .</p>

                  <p>Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have proven to be effective for software vulnerability detection, with a potential for substantial productivity enhancements for detecting vulnerabilities.Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring the more complex inter-procedural vulnerability detection scenarios in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions within repositories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>In addition, the widely-used benchmark datasets generally contain only intra-procedural vulnerabilities, leaving the assessment of inter-procedural vulnerability detection capabilities unexplored.   To mitigate the issues, we propose a repository-level evaluation system, named \textbf{VulEval}, aiming at evaluating the detection performance of inter- and intra-procedural vulnerabilities simultaneously.Specifically, VulEval consists of three interconnected evaluation tasks: \textbf{(1) Function-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting intra-procedural vulnerability given a code snippet; \textbf{(2) Vulnerability-Related Dependency Prediction}, aiming at retrieving the most relevant dependencies from call graphs for providing developers with explanations about the vulnerabilities; and \textbf{(3)Repository-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting inter-procedural vulnerabilities by combining with the dependencies identified in the second task.VulEval also consists of a large-scale dataset, with a total of 4,196 CVE entries, 232,239 functions, and corresponding 4,699 repository-level source code in C/C++ programming languages.Our analysis highlights the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including automated program repair (APR).In this study, we take a deep dive into automated bug fixing utilizing LLMs.In contrast to many deep learning-based APR methods that assume known bug locations, rely on line-level localization tools, or address bug prediction and fixing in one step, our approach uniquely employs LLMs to predict bug location at the token level and subsequently utilizes them for bug fixing.This methodological separation of bug localization and fixing using different LLMs enables effective integration of diverse contextual information and improved incorporation of inductive biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Toggle: Token-Granulated Bug Localization and Repair, a comprehensive program repair framework that integrates a bug localization model, an adjustment unit, and a bug-fixing model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Toggle takes a buggy function as input and generates a complete corrected function.We investigate various styles of prompting to the bug fixing model to identify the most effective prompts that better utilize the inductive bias and significantly outperform others.Toggle achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CodeXGLUE code refinement benchmark, and exhibits better and comparable performance on several other widely-used APR datasets, including Defects4J.</p>
