                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a new distance oracle in the fully dynamic setting: given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and an arbitrary parameter $\epsilon$ where $1/\log^{c} n<\epsilon<1$ and $c>0$ is a small constant, we can deterministically maintain a data structure with $n^{\epsilon}$ worst-case update time that, given any pair of vertices $(u,v)$, returns a $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}$-approximate distance between $u$ and $v$ in ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)\log\log n$ query time.   Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms.First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time.Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time.The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang[STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.   We obtain the result by dynamizing tools related to length-constrained expanders<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Haeupler-R\"acke-Ghaffari, STOC 2022; Haeupler-Hershkowitz-Tan, 2023; Haeupler-Huebotter-Ghaffari, 2022]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Our technique completely bypasses the 40-year-old Even-Shiloach tree, which has remained the most pervasive tool in the area but is inherently amortized.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions.There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments.To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments.LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration.We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration.We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of denoising hand-object interactions (HOI).Given an erroneous interaction sequence, the objective is to refine the incorrect hand trajectory to remove interaction artifacts for a perceptually realistic sequence.This challenge involves intricate interaction noise, including unnatural hand poses and incorrect hand-object relations, alongside the necessity for robust generalization to new interactions and diverse noise patterns.We tackle those challenges through a novel approach, GeneOH Diffusion, incorporating two key designs: an innovative contact-centric HOI representation named GeneOH and a new domain-generalizable denoising scheme.The contact-centric representation GeneOH informatively parameterizes the HOI process, facilitating enhanced generalization across various HOI scenarios.The new denoising scheme consists of a canonical denoising model trained to project noisy data samples from a whitened noise space to a clean data manifold and a "denoising via diffusion" strategy which can handle input trajectories with various noise patterns by first diffusing them to align with the whitened noise space and cleaning via the canonical denoiser.Extensive experiments on four benchmarks with significant domain variations demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method.GeneOH Diffusion also shows promise for various downstream applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>https://meowuu7.github.io/GeneOH-Diffusion/.</p>

                  <p>Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns.Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise.OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes.They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem.Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning.In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions.The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise.The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss.To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise.</p>

                  <p>Metaphor is a prominent linguistic device in human language and literature, as they add color, imagery, and emphasis to enhance effective communication.This paper introduces a large-scale high quality annotated Chinese Metaphor Corpus, which comprises around 28K sentences drawn from a diverse range of Chinese literary sources, such as poems, prose, song lyrics, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure the accuracy and consistency of our annotations, we introduce a comprehensive set of guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>These guidelines address the facets of metaphor annotation, including identifying tenors, vehicles, and grounds to handling the complexities of similes, personifications, juxtapositions, and hyperboles.Breaking tradition, our approach to metaphor generation emphasizes grounds and their distinct features rather than the conventional combination of tenors and vehicles.By integrating "ground" as a CoT (Chain of Thoughts) input, we are able to generate metaphors that resonate more with real-world intuition.We test generative models such as Belle, Baichuan, and Chinese-alpaca-33B using our annotated corpus.These models are able to generate creative and fluent metaphor sentences more frequently induced by selected samples from our dataset, demonstrating the value of our corpus for Chinese metaphor research.The code is available in the https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Chinese_Metaphor_Explanation-63F2.</p>

                  <p>Runtime Verification (RV) refers to a family of techniques in which system executions are observed and confronted to formal specifications, with the aim of identifying faults.In Offline RV, observation is done in a first step and verification in a second, on a static artifact collected during observation.In this paper, we define an approach to offline RV of Distributed Systems (DS) against interactions.Interactions are formal models describing communications within a DS.DS are composed of subsystems deployed on different machines and interacting via message passing.Therefore, observing executions of a DS entails logging a collection of local execution traces, one for each subsystem, that we call a multi-trace.A major challenge in analyzing multi-traces is that there are no practical means to synchronize the ends of observations of all local traces.We address this via an operation, called lifeline removal, which we apply on-the-fly on the specification during verification once a local trace has been entirely analyzed.This operation removes from the interaction the specification of actions occurring on the subsystem that is no-longer observed.This may allow further execution of the specification via removing deadlocks due to the partial orders of actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We prove the correctness of the resulting RV algorithm and introduce two optimization techniques which we also prove correct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>We implement a Partial Order Reduction (POR) technique via the selection of a one-unambiguous action (as a unique first step to a linearization) which existence is determined via another use of the lifeline removal operator.Additionally, Local Analyses (LOC) i.e., the verification of local traces, can be leveraged during the global multi-trace analysis to prove failure more quickly.Experiments illustrate the application of our RV approach and the benefits of our optimizations.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have revealed that federated learning (FL), once considered secure due to clients not sharing their private data with the server, is vulnerable to attacks such as client-side training data distribution inference, where a malicious client can recreate the victim's data.While various countermeasures exist, they are not practical, often assuming server access to some training data or knowledge of label distribution before the attack.   In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing InferGuard, a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation rule aimed at defending against client-side training data distribution inference attacks.In our proposed InferGuard, the server first calculates the coordinate-wise median of all the model updates it receives.A client's model update is considered malicious if it significantly deviates from the computed median update.We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed InferGuard on five benchmark datasets and perform a comparison with ten baseline methods.The results of our experiments indicate that our defense mechanism is highly effective in protecting against client-side training data distribution inference attacks, even against strong adaptive attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our method substantially outperforms the baseline methods in various practical FL scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTA) is a challenging task that aims to adapt a source pre-trained model to continually changing target domains.In the CTA setting, a model does not know when the target domain changes, thus facing a drastic change in the distribution of streaming inputs during the test-time.The key challenge is to keep adapting the model to the continually changing target domains in an online manner.We find that a model shows highly biased predictions as it constantly adapts to the chaining distribution of the target data.It predicts certain classes more often than other classes, making inaccurate over-confident predictions.This paper mitigates this issue to improve performance in the CTA scenario.To alleviate the bias issue, we make class-wise exponential moving average target prototypes with reliable target samples and exploit them to cluster the target features class-wisely.Moreover, we aim to align the target distributions to the source distribution by anchoring the target feature to its corresponding source prototype.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With extensive experiments, our proposed method achieves noteworthy performance gain when applied on top of existing CTA methods without substantial adaptation time overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems against presentation attacks.With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques, many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged.However, they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions.These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability, where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments, leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion, and (2) modality imbalance, where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others, reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable sorely using the dominant modality.To address modality unreliability, we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities.For modality imbalance, we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients.Besides, we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Source code and protocols will be released on https://github.com/OMGGGGG/mmdg.</p>

                  <p>In multimedia understanding tasks, corrupted samples pose a critical challenge, because when fed to machine learning models they lead to performance degradation.In the past, three groups of approaches have been proposed to handle noisy data: i) enhancer and denoiser modules to improve the quality of the noisy data, ii) data augmentation approaches, and iii) domain adaptation strategies.All the aforementioned approaches come with drawbacks that limit their applicability; the first has high computational costs and requires pairs of clean-corrupted data for training, while the others only allow deployment of the same task/network they were trained on (\ie, when upstream and downstream task/network are the same).In this paper, we propose SyMPIE to solve these shortcomings.To this end, we design a small, modular, and efficient (just 2GFLOPs to process a Full HD image) system to enhance input data for robust downstream multimedia understanding with minimal computational cost.Our SyMPIE is pre-trained on an upstream task/network that should not match the downstream ones and does not need paired clean-corrupted samples.Our key insight is that most input corruptions found in real-world tasks can be modeled through global operations on color channels of images or spatial filters with small kernels.We validate our approach on multiple datasets and tasks, such as image classification (on ImageNetC, ImageNetC-Bar, VizWiz, and a newly proposed mixed corruption benchmark named ImageNetC-mixed) and semantic segmentation (on Cityscapes, ACDC, and DarkZurich) with consistent improvements of about 5\% relative accuracy gain across the board.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of our approach and the new ImageNetC-mixed benchmark will be made available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are still many challenges in Federated Learning (FL).First, during the model update process, the model parameters on the local user need to be sent to the server for aggregation.This involves the consumption of network bandwidth, especially when the number of users participating in FL is large.High communication costs may limit the application of FL in certain scenarios.Secondly, since users participating in FL usually have different data distributions, this heterogeneity of data may lead to poor model performance or even failure to converge.Third, privacy and security issues are also challenges that need to be addressed in FL.There is still a risk of information leakage during model aggregation.Malicious users may obtain sensitive information by analyzing communications during model updates or aggregation processes.To address these challenges, we propose HyperFedNet (HFN), an innovative approach that leverages hypernetwork.HFN introduces a paradigm shift in transmission aggregation within FL.Unlike traditional FL methods that transmit a large number of parameters from the main network, HFN reduces the communication burden and improves security by transmitting a compact set of hypernetwork parameters.After the parameters of the hypernetwork are deployed locally to the user, the local database features quantified by the embedding vector can be used as input, and parameters can be dynamically generated for the FL main network through user forward propagation.HFN efficiently reduces communication costs while improving accuracy.Extensive experimentation demonstrates that HFN outperforms traditional FL methods significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By seamlessly integrating this concept into the conventional FL algorithm, we achieve even more impressive results compared to the original approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations.Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Parametric language models (LMs), which are trained on vast amounts of web data, exhibit remarkable flexibility and capability.However, they still face practical challenges such as hallucinations, difficulty in adapting to new data distributions, and a lack of verifiability.In this position paper, we advocate for retrieval-augmented LMs to replace parametric LMs as the next generation of LMs.By incorporating large-scale datastores during inference, retrieval-augmented LMs can be more reliable, adaptable, and attributable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their potential, retrieval-augmented LMs have yet to be widely adopted due to several obstacles: specifically, current retrieval-augmented LMs struggle to leverage helpful text beyond knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering, have limited interaction between retrieval and LM components, and lack the infrastructure for scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these, we propose a roadmap for developing general-purpose retrieval-augmented LMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This involves a reconsideration of datastores and retrievers, the exploration of pipelines with improved retriever-LM interaction, and significant investment in infrastructure for efficient training and inference.</p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>
