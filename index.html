                  <p>Large-scale text-to-video models have shown remarkable abilities, but their direct application in video editing remains challenging due to limited available datasets.Current video editing methods commonly require per-video fine-tuning of diffusion models or specific inversion optimization to ensure high-fidelity edits.In this paper, we introduce EffiVED, an efficient diffusion-based model that directly supports instruction-guided video editing.To achieve this, we present two efficient workflows to gather video editing pairs, utilizing augmentation and fundamental vision-language techniques.These workflows transform vast image editing datasets and open-world videos into a high-quality dataset for training EffiVED.Experimental results reveal that EffiVED not only generates high-quality editing videos but also executes rapidly.Finally, we demonstrate that our data collection method significantly improves editing performance and can potentially tackle the scarcity of video editing data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets will be made publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.918</span></span></p>

                  <p>Typical LiDAR-based 3D object detection models are trained in a supervised manner with real-world data collection, which is often imbalanced over classes (or long-tailed).To deal with it, augmenting minority-class examples by sampling ground truth (GT) LiDAR points from a database and pasting them into a scene of interest is often used, but challenges still remain: inflexibility in locating GT samples and limited sample diversity.In this work, we propose to leverage pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated (at a low cost) from videos capturing a surround view of miniatures or real-world objects of minor classes.Our method, called Pseudo Ground Truth Augmentation (PGT-Aug), consists of three main steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity estimation and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information.We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reconstructing photo-realistic drivable human avatars from multi-view image sequences has been a popular and challenging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics.While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are time-consuming.Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the human body, enabling faster training and rendering.However, they undermine the importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with coarse mesh guidance.This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and tends to produce blurry textures.Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space Gaussian textures.We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to extract features.Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian rendering and significantly enhancing rendering quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect and process a new dataset of human motion, which includes multi-view images, scanned models, parametric model registration, and corresponding texture maps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art synthesis of novel view and novel pose.The code and data will be made available on the homepage https://alex-jyj.github.io/UV-Gaussians/ once the paper is accepted.</p>

                  <p>The study of music-generated dance is a novel and challenging Image generation task.It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then generate natural dance movements for the subsequent music.Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects.This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music.In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module.First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance.Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation.Finally, we conducted experiments on the dataset AIST++, and the results show that our approach achieves better and more robust performance in generating accurate, high-quality dance movements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be available from https://github.com/MarasyZZ/QEAN and https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span></p>

                  <p>Surface prediction and completion have been widely studied in various applications.Recently, research in surface completion has evolved from small objects to complex large-scale scenes.As a result, researchers have begun increasing the volume of data and leveraging a greater variety of data modalities including rendered RGB images, descriptive texts, depth images, etc, to enhance algorithm performance.However, existing datasets suffer from a deficiency in the amounts of scene-level models along with the corresponding multi-modal information.Therefore, a method to scale the datasets and generate multi-modal information in them efficiently is essential.To bridge this research gap, we propose MASSTAR: a Multi-modal lArge-scale Scene dataset with a verSatile Toolchain for surfAce pRediction and completion.We develop a versatile and efficient toolchain for processing the raw 3D data from the environments.It screens out a set of fine-grained scene models and generates the corresponding multi-modal data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing the toolchain, we then generate an example dataset composed of over a thousand scene-level models with partial real-world data added. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>We compare MASSTAR with the existing datasets, which validates its superiority: the ability to efficiently extract high-quality models from complex scenarios to expand the dataset.Additionally, several representative surface completion algorithms are benchmarked on MASSTAR, which reveals that existing algorithms can hardly deal with scene-level completion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the source code of our toolchain and the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.948</span></span>For more details, please see our project page at https://sysu-star.github.io/MASSTAR.</p>

                  <p>To thoroughly assess the mathematical reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we need to carefully curate evaluation datasets covering diverse mathematical concepts and mathematical problems at different difficulty levels.In pursuit of this objective, we propose FineMath in this paper, a fine-grained mathematical evaluation benchmark dataset for assessing Chinese LLMs.FineMath is created to cover the major key mathematical concepts taught in elementary school math, which are further divided into 17 categories of math word problems, enabling in-depth analysis of mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs.All the 17 categories of math word problems are manually annotated with their difficulty levels according to the number of reasoning steps required to solve these problems.We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs on FineMath and find that there is still considerable room for improvements in terms of mathematical reasoning capability of Chinese LLMs.We also carry out an in-depth analysis on the evaluation process and methods that have been overlooked previously.These two factors significantly influence the model results and our understanding of their mathematical reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset will be publicly available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.97</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough results, opening countless new possibilities for many practical applications.However, LLMs lack elementary safety features that are established norms in other areas of computer science, such as the separation between instructions and data, causing them to malfunction or rendering them vulnerable to manipulation and interference by third parties e.g., via indirect prompt/command injection.Even worse, so far, there is not even an established definition of what precisely such a separation would mean and how its violation could be tested.In this work, we aim to close this gap.We introduce a formal measure to quantify the phenomenon of instruction-data separation as well as an empirical variant of the measure that can be computed from a model`s black-box outputs.We also introduce a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), which allows estimating the measure, and we report results on several state-of-the-art open-source and closed LLMs.Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs fail to achieve a high amount of separation, according to our measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment.In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations.The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions.Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background.However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task.Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes.We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models.This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Storing intermediate frame segmentations as memory for long-range context modeling, spatial-temporal memory-based methods have recently showcased impressive results in semi-supervised video object segmentation (SVOS).However, these methods face two key limitations: 1) relying on non-local pixel-level matching to read memory, resulting in noisy retrieved features for segmentation; 2) segmenting each object independently without interaction.These shortcomings make the memory-based methods struggle in similar object and multi-object segmentation.To address these issues, we propose a query modulation method, termed QMVOS.This method summarizes object features into dynamic queries and then treats them as dynamic filters for mask prediction, thereby providing high-level descriptions and object-level perception for the model.Efficient and effective multi-object interactions are realized through inter-query attention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can bring significant improvements to the memory-based SVOS method and achieve competitive performance on standard SVOS benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/zht8506/QMVOS.</p>

                  <p>Efficient recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences.Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interaction relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms.Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant shortcomings: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations in the behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios.In this study, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges.It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interaction relations, and includes a relation chain representation learning and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern.Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our \model surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06\% and 12.15\% on average across all datasets in terms of R@10 and N@10 respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the domain of text-guided image generation and, more recently, in text-guided image editing.A commonly adopted strategy for editing real images involves inverting the diffusion process to obtain a noisy representation of the original image, which is then denoised to achieve the desired edits.However, current methods for diffusion inversion often struggle to produce edits that are both faithful to the specified text prompt and closely resemble the source image.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and adaptable diffusion inversion technique for real image editing, which is grounded in a theoretical analysis of the role of $\eta$ in the DDIM sampling equation for enhanced editability.By designing a universal diffusion inversion method with a time- and region-dependent $\eta$ function, we enable flexible control over the editing extent.Through a comprehensive series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, involving a comparison with a broad array of recent methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method not only sets a new benchmark in the field but also significantly outperforms existing strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/eta-inversion</p>

Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.   Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.   It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.   This is achieved by the two terms:   (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.   (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D correspondence, i.e., a pair of 3D points, is a fundamental concept in computer vision.A set of 3D correspondences, when equipped with compatibility edges, forms a correspondence graph.This graph is a critical component in several state-of-the-art 3D point cloud registration approaches, e.g., the one based on maximal cliques (MAC).However, its properties have not been well understood.So we present the first study that introduces graph signal processing into the domain of correspondence graph.We exploit the generalized degree signal on correspondence graph and pursue sampling strategies that preserve high-frequency components of this signal.To address time-consuming singular value decomposition in deterministic sampling, we resort to a stochastic approximate sampling strategy.As such, the core of our method is the stochastic spectral sampling of correspondence graph.As an application, we build a complete 3D registration algorithm termed as FastMAC, that reaches real-time speed while leading to little to none performance drop.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we validate that FastMAC works for both indoor and outdoor benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>For example, FastMAC can accelerate MAC by 80 times while maintaining high registration success rate on KITTI.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Forrest-110/FastMAC.</p>

                  <p>By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels.Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability.To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information.In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain.Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task.Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time.To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment.To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

We show how cooperative exporting among agri-food SMEs can tackle the barriers posed by the MQCs, and give market access to a broader range of SMEs.We formulate a class of cooperative games associated with these situations and find a gain-sharing mechanism that result in allocations in their corresponding cores.Thus, grand coalitions of cooperative exporting SMEs can form in stable manners.

                  <p>When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think.Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text.For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation.In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer.This is a highly constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text.We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions.We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens.To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique.Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions.In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%$\rightarrow$10.9%) and CommonsenseQA(36.3%$\rightarrow$47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text.Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code revert prediction, a specialized form of software defect detection, aims to forecast or predict the likelihood of code changes being reverted or rolled back in software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is very important in practice because by identifying code changes that are more prone to being reverted, developers and project managers can proactively take measures to prevent issues, improve code quality, and optimize development processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>However, compared to code defect detection, code revert prediction has been rarely studied in previous research.Additionally, many previous methods for code defect detection relied on independent features but ignored relationships between code scripts.Moreover, new challenges are introduced due to constraints in an industry setting such as company regulation, limited features and large-scale codebase.To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a systematic empirical study for code revert prediction that integrates the code import graph with code features.Different strategies to address anomalies and data imbalance have been implemented including graph neural networks with imbalance classification and anomaly detection.We conduct the experiments on real-world code commit data within J.P. Morgan Chase which is extremely imbalanced in order to make a comprehensive comparison of these different approaches for the code revert prediction problem.</p>
