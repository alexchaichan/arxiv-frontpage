                  <p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough results, opening countless new possibilities for many practical applications.However, LLMs lack elementary safety features that are established norms in other areas of computer science, such as the separation between instructions and data, causing them to malfunction or rendering them vulnerable to manipulation and interference by third parties e.g., via indirect prompt/command injection.Even worse, so far, there is not even an established definition of what precisely such a separation would mean and how its violation could be tested.In this work, we aim to close this gap.We introduce a formal measure to quantify the phenomenon of instruction-data separation as well as an empirical variant of the measure that can be computed from a model`s black-box outputs.We also introduce a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), which allows estimating the measure, and we report results on several state-of-the-art open-source and closed LLMs.Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs fail to achieve a high amount of separation, according to our measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>High-performing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, both anomaly and novel class, is an important prerequisite for the practical use of classification models.In this paper, we focus on the species recognition task in images concerned with large databases, a large number of fine-grained hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, and varying image quality.We propose a framework for combining individual OOD measures into one combined OOD (COOD) measure using a supervised model.The individual measures are several existing state-of-the-art measures and several novel OOD measures developed with novel class detection and hierarchical class structure in mind.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>COOD was extensively evaluated on three large-scale (500k+ images) biodiversity datasets in the context of anomaly and novel class detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>We show that COOD outperforms individual, including state-of-the-art, OOD measures by a large margin in terms of TPR@1% FPR in the majority of experiments, e.g., improving detecting ImageNet images (OOD) from 54.3% to 85.4% for the iNaturalist 2018 dataset.SHAP (feature contribution) analysis shows that different individual OOD measures are essential for various tasks, indicating that multiple OOD measures and combinations are needed to generalize.Additionally, we show that explicitly considering ID images that are incorrectly classified for the original (species) recognition task is important for constructing high-performing OOD detection methods and for practical applicability.The framework can easily be extended or adapted to other tasks and media modalities.</p>

                  <p>Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment.In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations.The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions.Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background.However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task.Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes.We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models.This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing demand for automatic high-level image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) within images, underscores the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches.These approaches need to harmonize traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced, context-dependent knowledge humans employ to interpret images at intricate semantic levels.In this work, we leverage situated perceptual knowledge of cultural images to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification.We automatically extract perceptual semantic units from images, which we then model and integrate into the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This resource captures situated perceptual semantics gleaned from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Additionally, we enhance the AKG with high-level linguistic frames.We compute KG embeddings and experiment with relative representations and hybrid approaches that fuse these embeddings with visual transformer embeddings.Finally, for interpretability, we conduct posthoc qualitative analyses by examining model similarities with training instances.Our results show that our hybrid KGE-ViT methods outperform existing techniques in AC image classification.The posthoc interpretability analyses reveal the visual transformer's proficiency in capturing pixel-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing more abstract and semantic scene elements.We demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding for AC image classification.This work suggests a strong potential of neuro-symbolic methods for knowledge integration and robust image representation for use in downstream intricate visual comprehension tasks.All the materials and code are available online.</p>

                  <p>Understanding a surgical scene is crucial for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide any intelligent assistance functionality.One way of achieving this scene understanding is via scene segmentation, where every pixel of a frame is classified and therefore identifies the visible structures and tissues.Progress on fully segmenting surgical scenes has been made using machine learning.However, such models require large amounts of annotated training data, containing examples of all relevant object classes.Such fully annotated datasets are hard to create, as every pixel in a frame needs to be annotated by medical experts and, therefore, are rarely available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a method to combine multiple partially annotated datasets, which provide complementary annotations, into one model, enabling better scene segmentation and the use of multiple readily available datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Our method aims to combine available data with complementary labels by leveraging mutual exclusive properties to maximize information.Specifically, we propose to use positive annotations of other classes as negative samples and to exclude background pixels of binary annotations, as we cannot tell if they contain a class not annotated but predicted by the model.We evaluate our method by training a DeepLabV3 on the publicly available Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary segmented anatomical structures.Our approach successfully combines 6 classes into one model, increasing the overall Dice Score by 4.4% compared to an ensemble of models trained on the classes individually.By including information on multiple classes, we were able to reduce confusion between stomach and colon by 24%.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training a model on multiple datasets.This paves the way for future work further alleviating the need for one large, fully segmented datasets.</p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a new distance oracle in the fully dynamic setting: given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and an arbitrary parameter $\epsilon$ where $1/\log^{c} n<\epsilon<1$ and $c>0$ is a small constant, we can deterministically maintain a data structure with $n^{\epsilon}$ worst-case update time that, given any pair of vertices $(u,v)$, returns a $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}$-approximate distance between $u$ and $v$ in ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)\log\log n$ query time.   Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms.First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time.Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time.The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang[STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.

                  <p>By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels.Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability.To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information.In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain.Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task.Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time.To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment.To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: Static analyses are well-established to aid in understanding bugs or vulnerabilities during the development process or in large-scale studies.A low false-positive rate is essential for the adaption in practice and for precise results of empirical studies.Unfortunately, static analyses tend to report where a vulnerability manifests rather than the fix location.This can cause presumed false positives or imprecise results.Method: To address this problem, we designed an adaption of an existing static analysis algorithm that can distinguish between a manifestation and fix location, and reports error chains.An error chain represents at least two interconnected errors that occur successively, thus building the connection between the fix and manifestation location.We used our tool CogniCryptSUBS for a case study on 471 GitHub repositories, a performance benchmark to compare different analysis configurations, and conducted an expert interview.Result:We found that 50 % of the projects with a report had at least one error chain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our runtime benchmark demonstrated that our improvement caused only a minimal runtime overhead of less than 4 %. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>The results of our expert interview indicate that with our adapted version participants require fewer executions of the analysis.Conclusion: Our results indicate that error chains occur frequently in real-world projects, and ignoring them can lead to imprecise evaluation results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The runtime benchmark indicates that our tool is a feasible and efficient solution for detecting error chains in real-world projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, our results gave a hint that the usability of static analyses may benefit from supporting error chains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) stands as an effective intervention for alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).Traditional commercial DBS devices are only able to deliver fixed-frequency periodic pulses to the basal ganglia (BG) regions of the brain, i.e., continuous DBS (cDBS).However, they in general suffer from energy inefficiency and side effects, such as speech impairment.Recent research has focused on adaptive DBS (aDBS) to resolve the limitations of cDBS.Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches have been developed to adapt the frequencies of the stimuli in order to achieve both energy efficiency and treatment efficacy.However, RL approaches in general require significant amount of training data and computational resources, making it intractable to integrate RL policies into real-time embedded systems as needed in aDBS.In contrast, contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) in general lead to better sample efficiency compared to RL.In this study, we propose a CMAB solution for aDBS.Specifically, we define the context as the signals capturing irregular neuronal firing activities in the BG regions (i.e., beta-band power spectral density), while each arm signifies the (discretized) pulse frequency of the stimulation.Moreover, an {\epsilon}-exploring strategy is introduced on top of the classic Thompson sampling method, leading to an algorithm called {\epsilon}-Neural Thompson sampling ({\epsilon}-NeuralTS), such that the learned CMAB policy can better balance exploration and exploitation of the BG environment.The {\epsilon}-NeuralTS algorithm is evaluated using a computation BG model that captures the neuronal activities in PD patients' brains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our method outperforms both existing cDBS methods and CMAB baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span></p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical.While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge.Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence.   Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training.Because of this, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care.Large language models can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers as educational tools or as adjunct to care.This study aimed to develop a reliable Caregiving Language Model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and evaluate the performance of the model compared to a large FM.We developed CaLM using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base.We used two small FMs as candidates for the FM of CaLM (LLaMA-2 and Falcon with 7B parameters) and larger FM GPT-3.5 as a benchmark.We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the Internet.In this study, we focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the models' performance using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability to provide accurate references with the answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures.As expected, the large FM performed better than small FMs across all metrics.The most interesting result is that small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics.The fine-tuned LLaMA-2 small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers.The study shows that reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed by using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain.</p>

                  <p>Purpose:Advances in deep learning have resulted in effective models for surgical video analysis; however, these models often fail to generalize across medical centers due to domain shift caused by variations in surgical workflow, camera setups, and patient demographics.Recently, object-centric learning has emerged as a promising approach for improved surgical scene understanding, capturing and disentangling visual and semantic properties of surgical tools and anatomy to improve downstream task performance.In this work, we conduct a multi-centric performance benchmark of object-centric approaches, focusing on Critical View of Safety assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, then propose an improved approach for unseen domain generalization.   Methods: We evaluate four object-centric approaches for domain generalization, establishing baseline performance.Next, leveraging the disentangled nature of object-centric representations, we dissect one of these methods through a series of ablations (e.g. ignoring either visual or semantic features for downstream classification).Finally, based on the results of these ablations, we develop an optimized method specifically tailored for domain generalization, LG-DG, that includes a novel disentanglement loss function.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: Our optimized approach, LG-DG, achieves an improvement of 9.28% over the best baseline approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>More broadly, we show that object-centric approaches are highly effective for domain generalization thanks to their modular approach to representation learning.   Conclusion: We investigate the use of object-centric methods for unseen domain generalization, identify method-agnostic factors critical for performance, and present an optimized approach that substantially outperforms existing methods.</p>

                  <p>Syntactic parsing remains a critical tool for relation extraction and information extraction, especially in resource-scarce languages where LLMs are lacking.Yet in morphologically rich languages (MRLs), where parsers need to identify multiple lexical units in each token, existing systems suffer in latency and setup complexity.Some use a pipeline to peel away the layers: first segmentation, then morphology tagging, and then syntax parsing; however, errors in earlier layers are then propagated forward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Others use a joint architecture to evaluate all permutations at once; while this improves accuracy, it is notoriously slow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>In contrast, and taking Hebrew as a test case, we present a new "flipped pipeline": decisions are made directly on the whole-token units by expert classifiers, each one dedicated to one specific task.The classifiers are independent of one another, and only at the end do we synthesize their predictions.This blazingly fast approach sets a new SOTA in Hebrew POS tagging and dependency parsing, while also reaching near-SOTA performance on other Hebrew NLP tasks.Because our architecture does not rely on any language-specific resources, it can serve as a model to develop similar parsers for other MRLs.</p>

On the experimental side, we extract real-world sequences of customer orders from publicly-available JD.com data and evaluate different combinations of placement and fulfillment procedures.Optimizing the Offline surrogate performs best overall, even compared to simulation procedures, corroborating our theory.</p>

                  <p>Terrestrial networks form the fundamental infrastructure of modern communication systems, serving more than 4 billion users globally.However, terrestrial networks are facing a wide range of challenges, from coverage and reliability to interference and congestion.As the demands of the 6G era are expected to be much higher, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for the future.To address these problems, Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) has emerged to be a promising solution.NTNs are communication networks that leverage airborne (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) and spaceborne vehicles (e.g., satellites) to facilitate ultra-reliable communications and connectivity with high data rates and low latency over expansive regions.This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the utilization of network slicing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) to address diverse challenges of NTNs from the perspectives of both academia and industry.Particularly, we first provide an in-depth tutorial on NTN and the key enabling technologies including network slicing, AI/ML, and ORAN.Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on how network slicing and AI/ML have been leveraged to overcome the challenges that NTNs are facing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we present how ORAN can be utilized for NTNs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of NTN in the 6G era.</p>

                  <p>Counting (p,q)-bicliques in bipartite graphs poses a foundational challenge with broad applications, from densest subgraph discovery in algorithmic research to personalized content recommendation in practical scenarios.Despite its significance, current leading (p,q)-biclique counting algorithms fall short, particularly when faced with larger graph sizes and clique scales.Fortunately, the problem's inherent structure, allowing for the independent counting of each biclique starting from every vertex, combined with a substantial set intersections, makes it highly amenable to parallelization.Recent successes in GPU-accelerated algorithms across various domains motivate our exploration into harnessing the parallelism power of GPUs to efficiently address the (p,q)-biclique counting challenge.We introduce GBC (GPU-based Biclique Counting), a novel approach designed to enable efficient and scalable (p,q)-biclique counting on GPUs.To address major bottleneck arising from redundant comparisons in set intersections (occupying an average of 90% of the runtime), we introduce a novel data structure that hashes adjacency lists into truncated bitmaps to enable efficient set intersection on GPUs via bit-wise AND operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our innovative hybrid DFS-BFS exploration strategy further enhances thread utilization and effectively manages memory constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>A composite load balancing strategy, integrating pre-runtime and runtime workload allocation, ensures equitable distribution among threads.Additionally, we employ vertex reordering and graph partitioning strategies for improved compactness and scalability.Experimental evaluations on eight real-life and two synthetic datasets demonstrate that GBC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a substantial margin.In particular, GBC achieves an average speedup of 497.8x, with the largest instance achieving a remarkable 1217.7x speedup when p = q = 8.</p>

We propose TCAM-SSD, a new framework for search-based computation inside the NAND flash memory arrays of a conventional solid-state drive (SSD), which requires lightweight modifications to only the array periphery and firmware.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TCAM-SSD introduces a search manager and link table, which can logically partition the NAND flash memory's contents into search-enabled regions and standard storage regions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Together, these light firmware changes enable TCAM-SSD to seamlessly handle block I/O operations, in addition to new search operations, thereby reducing end-to-end execution time and total data movement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide an NVMe-compatible interface that provides programmers with the ability to dynamically allocate data on and make use of TCAM-SSD, allowing the system to be leveraged by a wide variety of applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate three example use cases of TCAM-SSD to demonstrate its benefits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>For transactional databases, TCAM-SSD can mitigate the performance penalties for applications with large datasets, achieving a 60.9% speedup over a conventional system that retrieves data from the SSD and computes using the CPU.For database analytics, TCAM-SSD provides an average speedup of 17.7x over a conventional system for a collection of analytical queries.For graph analytics, we combine TCAM-SSD's associative search with a sparse data structure, speeding up graph computing for larger-than-memory datasets by 14.5%.</p>

                  <p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions.However, these T2I generation models often fall short of generating images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects.In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, SELMA leverages an LLM's in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging.Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets.We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation.Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data.Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models.</p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>
