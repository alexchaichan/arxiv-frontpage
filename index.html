                  <p>The increasing demand for automatic high-level image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) within images, underscores the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches.These approaches need to harmonize traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced, context-dependent knowledge humans employ to interpret images at intricate semantic levels.In this work, we leverage situated perceptual knowledge of cultural images to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification.We automatically extract perceptual semantic units from images, which we then model and integrate into the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This resource captures situated perceptual semantics gleaned from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Additionally, we enhance the AKG with high-level linguistic frames.We compute KG embeddings and experiment with relative representations and hybrid approaches that fuse these embeddings with visual transformer embeddings.Finally, for interpretability, we conduct posthoc qualitative analyses by examining model similarities with training instances.Our results show that our hybrid KGE-ViT methods outperform existing techniques in AC image classification.The posthoc interpretability analyses reveal the visual transformer's proficiency in capturing pixel-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing more abstract and semantic scene elements.We demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding for AC image classification.This work suggests a strong potential of neuro-symbolic methods for knowledge integration and robust image representation for use in downstream intricate visual comprehension tasks.All the materials and code are available online.</p>

                  <p>Understanding a surgical scene is crucial for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide any intelligent assistance functionality.One way of achieving this scene understanding is via scene segmentation, where every pixel of a frame is classified and therefore identifies the visible structures and tissues.Progress on fully segmenting surgical scenes has been made using machine learning.However, such models require large amounts of annotated training data, containing examples of all relevant object classes.Such fully annotated datasets are hard to create, as every pixel in a frame needs to be annotated by medical experts and, therefore, are rarely available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a method to combine multiple partially annotated datasets, which provide complementary annotations, into one model, enabling better scene segmentation and the use of multiple readily available datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Our method aims to combine available data with complementary labels by leveraging mutual exclusive properties to maximize information.Specifically, we propose to use positive annotations of other classes as negative samples and to exclude background pixels of binary annotations, as we cannot tell if they contain a class not annotated but predicted by the model.We evaluate our method by training a DeepLabV3 on the publicly available Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary segmented anatomical structures.Our approach successfully combines 6 classes into one model, increasing the overall Dice Score by 4.4% compared to an ensemble of models trained on the classes individually.By including information on multiple classes, we were able to reduce confusion between stomach and colon by 24%.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training a model on multiple datasets.This paves the way for future work further alleviating the need for one large, fully segmented datasets.</p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>The quality of the data and annotation upper-bounds the quality of a downstream model.While there exist large text corpora and image-text pairs, high-quality video-text data is much harder to collect.First of all, manual labeling is more time-consuming, as it requires an annotator to watch an entire video.Second, videos have a temporal dimension, consisting of several scenes stacked together, and showing multiple actions.Accordingly, to establish a video dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as textual video description, subtitles, and individual video frames.Specifically, we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos from the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset.We then split them into semantically consistent video clips, and apply multiple cross-modality teacher models to obtain captions for each video.Next, we finetune a retrieval model on a small subset where the best caption of each video is manually selected and then employ the model in the whole dataset to select the best caption as the annotation.In this way, we get 70M videos paired with high-quality text captions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We dub the dataset as Panda-70M.

                  <p>We present a new distance oracle in the fully dynamic setting: given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and an arbitrary parameter $\epsilon$ where $1/\log^{c} n<\epsilon<1$ and $c>0$ is a small constant, we can deterministically maintain a data structure with $n^{\epsilon}$ worst-case update time that, given any pair of vertices $(u,v)$, returns a $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}$-approximate distance between $u$ and $v$ in ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)\log\log n$ query time.   Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms.First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time.Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time.The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang[STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.   We obtain the result by dynamizing tools related to length-constrained expanders<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Haeupler-R\"acke-Ghaffari, STOC 2022; Haeupler-Hershkowitz-Tan, 2023; Haeupler-Huebotter-Ghaffari, 2022]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Our technique completely bypasses the 40-year-old Even-Shiloach tree, which has remained the most pervasive tool in the area but is inherently amortized.</p>

                  <p>Adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (ARAG) aims to dynamically determine the necessity of retrieval for queries instead of retrieving indiscriminately to enhance the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information.However, previous works largely overlook the evaluation of ARAG approaches, leading to their effectiveness being understudied.This work presents a benchmark, RetrievalQA, comprising 1,271 short-form questions covering new world and long-tail knowledge.The knowledge necessary to answer the questions is absent from LLMs; therefore, external information must be retrieved to answer correctly.This makes RetrievalQA a suitable testbed to evaluate existing ARAG methods.We observe that calibration-based methods heavily rely on threshold tuning, while vanilla prompting is inadequate for guiding LLMs to make reliable retrieval decisions.Based on our findings, we propose Time-Aware Adaptive Retrieval (TA-ARE), a simple yet effective method that helps LLMs assess the necessity of retrieval without calibration or additional training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be available at \url{https://github.com/hyintell/RetrievalQA} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions.There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments.To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments.LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration.We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration.We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of denoising hand-object interactions (HOI).Given an erroneous interaction sequence, the objective is to refine the incorrect hand trajectory to remove interaction artifacts for a perceptually realistic sequence.This challenge involves intricate interaction noise, including unnatural hand poses and incorrect hand-object relations, alongside the necessity for robust generalization to new interactions and diverse noise patterns.We tackle those challenges through a novel approach, GeneOH Diffusion, incorporating two key designs: an innovative contact-centric HOI representation named GeneOH and a new domain-generalizable denoising scheme.The contact-centric representation GeneOH informatively parameterizes the HOI process, facilitating enhanced generalization across various HOI scenarios.The new denoising scheme consists of a canonical denoising model trained to project noisy data samples from a whitened noise space to a clean data manifold and a "denoising via diffusion" strategy which can handle input trajectories with various noise patterns by first diffusing them to align with the whitened noise space and cleaning via the canonical denoiser.Extensive experiments on four benchmarks with significant domain variations demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method.GeneOH Diffusion also shows promise for various downstream applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>https://meowuu7.github.io/GeneOH-Diffusion/.</p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and have become capable of solving a plethora of tasks through proper instructions in natural language.However, the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English, the de facto prompting language.Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task, even for the most advanced LLMs.Currently, there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present RoCode, a competitive programming dataset, consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models.Through our results and review of related works, we argue for the need to develop code models for languages other than English.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems against presentation attacks.With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques, many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged.However, they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions.These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability, where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments, leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion, and (2) modality imbalance, where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others, reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable sorely using the dominant modality.To address modality unreliability, we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities.For modality imbalance, we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients.Besides, we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Source code and protocols will be released on https://github.com/OMGGGGG/mmdg.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing multimedia information, multimodal recommendation has received extensive attention.It utilizes multimodal information to alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, thus improving recommendation accuracy.However, the reliance on labeled data severely limits the performance of multimodal recommendation models.Recently, self-supervised learning has been used in multimodal recommendations to mitigate the label sparsity problem.Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods cannot avoid the modality noise when aligning multimodal information due to the large differences in the distributions of different modalities.To this end, we propose a Multi-level sElf-supervised learNing for mulTimOdal Recommendation (MENTOR) method to address the label sparsity problem and the modality alignment problem.Specifically, MENTOR first enhances the specific features of each modality using the graph convolutional network (GCN) and fuses the visual and textual modalities.It then enhances the item representation via the item semantic graph for all modalities, including the fused modality.Then, it introduces two multilevel self-supervised tasks: the multilevel cross-modal alignment task and the general feature enhancement task.The multilevel cross-modal alignment task aligns each modality under the guidance of the ID embedding from multiple levels while maintaining the historical interaction information.The general feature enhancement task enhances the general feature from both the graph and feature perspectives to improve the robustness of our model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/MENTOR.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation.However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs.However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs.This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task.To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements.Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks.Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask.Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation.To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%.On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%.</p>

                  <p>In multimedia understanding tasks, corrupted samples pose a critical challenge, because when fed to machine learning models they lead to performance degradation.In the past, three groups of approaches have been proposed to handle noisy data: i) enhancer and denoiser modules to improve the quality of the noisy data, ii) data augmentation approaches, and iii) domain adaptation strategies.All the aforementioned approaches come with drawbacks that limit their applicability; the first has high computational costs and requires pairs of clean-corrupted data for training, while the others only allow deployment of the same task/network they were trained on (\ie, when upstream and downstream task/network are the same).In this paper, we propose SyMPIE to solve these shortcomings.To this end, we design a small, modular, and efficient (just 2GFLOPs to process a Full HD image) system to enhance input data for robust downstream multimedia understanding with minimal computational cost.Our SyMPIE is pre-trained on an upstream task/network that should not match the downstream ones and does not need paired clean-corrupted samples.Our key insight is that most input corruptions found in real-world tasks can be modeled through global operations on color channels of images or spatial filters with small kernels.We validate our approach on multiple datasets and tasks, such as image classification (on ImageNetC, ImageNetC-Bar, VizWiz, and a newly proposed mixed corruption benchmark named ImageNetC-mixed) and semantic segmentation (on Cityscapes, ACDC, and DarkZurich) with consistent improvements of about 5\% relative accuracy gain across the board.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of our approach and the new ImageNetC-mixed benchmark will be made available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep extreme classification (XC) aims to train an encoder architecture and an accompanying classifier architecture to tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a very large universe of labels.XC applications in ranking, recommendation and tagging routinely encounter tail labels for which the amount of training data is exceedingly small.Graph convolutional networks (GCN) present a convenient but computationally expensive way to leverage task metadata and enhance model accuracies in these settings.This paper formally establishes that in several use cases, the steep computational cost of GCNs is entirely avoidable by replacing GCNs with non-GCN architectures.The paper notices that in these settings, it is much more effective to use graph data to regularize encoder training than to implement a GCN.Based on these insights, an alternative paradigm RAMEN is presented to utilize graph metadata in XC settings that offers significant performance boosts with zero increase in inference computational costs.RAMEN scales to datasets with up to 1M labels and offers prediction accuracy up to 15% higher on benchmark datasets than state of the art methods, including those that use graph metadata to train GCNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RAMEN also offers 10% higher accuracy over the best baseline on a proprietary recommendation dataset sourced from click logs of a popular search engine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Code for RAMEN will be released publicly.</p>

                  <p>There are still many challenges in Federated Learning (FL).First, during the model update process, the model parameters on the local user need to be sent to the server for aggregation.This involves the consumption of network bandwidth, especially when the number of users participating in FL is large.High communication costs may limit the application of FL in certain scenarios.Secondly, since users participating in FL usually have different data distributions, this heterogeneity of data may lead to poor model performance or even failure to converge.Third, privacy and security issues are also challenges that need to be addressed in FL.There is still a risk of information leakage during model aggregation.Malicious users may obtain sensitive information by analyzing communications during model updates or aggregation processes.To address these challenges, we propose HyperFedNet (HFN), an innovative approach that leverages hypernetwork.HFN introduces a paradigm shift in transmission aggregation within FL.Unlike traditional FL methods that transmit a large number of parameters from the main network, HFN reduces the communication burden and improves security by transmitting a compact set of hypernetwork parameters.After the parameters of the hypernetwork are deployed locally to the user, the local database features quantified by the embedding vector can be used as input, and parameters can be dynamically generated for the FL main network through user forward propagation.HFN efficiently reduces communication costs while improving accuracy.Extensive experimentation demonstrates that HFN outperforms traditional FL methods significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By seamlessly integrating this concept into the conventional FL algorithm, we achieve even more impressive results compared to the original approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, the application of Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) in learning with noisy labels (LNL) has shown promising advancements due to its remarkable ability to learn well-distributed representations for better distinguishing noisy labels.However, CRL is mainly used as a pre-training technique, leading to a complicated multi-stage training pipeline.We also observed that trivially combining CRL with supervised LNL methods decreases performance.Using different images from the same class as negative pairs in CRL creates optimization conflicts between CRL and the supervised loss.To address these two issues, we propose an end-to-end PLReMix framework that avoids the complicated pipeline by introducing a Pseudo-Label Relaxed (PLR) contrastive loss to alleviate the conflicts between losses.This PLR loss constructs a reliable negative set of each sample by filtering out its inappropriate negative pairs that overlap at the top k indices of prediction probabilities, leading to more compact semantic clusters than vanilla CRL.Furthermore, a two-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is adopted to distinguish clean and noisy samples by leveraging semantic information and model outputs simultaneously, which is expanded on the previously widely used one-dimensional form.The PLR loss and a semi-supervised loss are simultaneously applied to train on the GMM divided clean and noisy samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed PLR loss is scalable, which can be easily integrated into other LNL methods and boost their performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Codes will be available.</p>

In this study, we introduce a novel framework for exploring CTMCs, emphasizing the influence of observed trails' length and mixture parameters on problem regimes, which demands specific algorithms.Through thorough experimentation, we examine the impact of discretizing continuous-time trails on the learnability of the continuous-time mixture, given that these processes are often observed via discrete, resource-demanding observations.Our comparative analysis with leading methods explores sample complexity and the trade-off between the number of trails and their lengths, offering crucial insights for method selection in different problem instances.We apply our algorithms on an extensive collection of Lastfm's user-generated trails spanning three years, demonstrating the capability of our algorithms to differentiate diverse user preferences.We pioneer the use of CTMC mixtures on a basketball passing dataset to unveil intricate offensive tactics of NBA teams.This underscores the pragmatic utility and versatility of our proposed framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All results presented in this study are replicable, and we provide the implementations to facilitate reproducibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

We design algorithms for this search task on unknown graphs.We establish the first formal guarantees on unknown weighted graphs and provide lower bounds showing that the algorithms we propose have optimal or nearly-optimal dependence on the prediction error.Further, we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in addition to being robust to adversarial error, our algorithms perform well in typical instances in which the error is stochastic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we provide alternative simpler performance bounds on the algorithms of Banerjee et al.

                  <p>Semantic image synthesis (SIS) is a task to generate realistic images corresponding to semantic maps (labels).It can be applied to diverse real-world practices such as photo editing or content creation.However, in real-world applications, SIS often encounters noisy user inputs.To address this, we propose Stochastic Conditional Diffusion Model (SCDM), which is a robust conditional diffusion model that features novel forward and generation processes tailored for SIS with noisy labels.It enhances robustness by stochastically perturbing the semantic label maps through Label Diffusion, which diffuses the labels with discrete diffusion.Through the diffusion of labels, the noisy and clean semantic maps become similar as the timestep increases, eventually becoming identical at $t=T$. This facilitates the generation of an image close to a clean image, enabling robust generation.Furthermore, we propose a class-wise noise schedule to differentially diffuse the labels depending on the class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that the proposed method generates high-quality samples through extensive experiments and analyses on benchmark datasets, including a novel experimental setup simulating human errors during real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>
