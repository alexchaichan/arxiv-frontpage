                  <p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves.We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages.This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process.In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level.Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts.The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens.Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB.Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study delves into the realm of multi-modality (i.e., video and motion modalities) human behavior understanding by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).Diverging from recent LLMs designed for video-only or motion-only understanding, we argue that understanding human behavior necessitates joint modeling from both videos and motion sequences (e.g., SMPL sequences) to capture nuanced body part dynamics and semantics effectively.In light of this, we present MotionLLM, a straightforward yet effective framework for human motion understanding, captioning, and reasoning.Specifically, MotionLLM adopts a unified video-motion training strategy that leverages the complementary advantages of existing coarse video-text data and fine-grained motion-text data to glean rich spatial-temporal insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we collect a substantial dataset, MoVid, comprising diverse videos, motions, captions, and instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Additionally, we propose the MoVid-Bench, with carefully manual annotations, for better evaluation of human behavior understanding on video and motion.Extensive experiments show the superiority of MotionLLM in the caption, spatial-temporal comprehension, and reasoning ability.</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing data provide a low-cost solution for large-scale monitoring of air pollution via the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), but is often limited by cloud contamination.Existing methods for AOD reconstruction rely on temporal information.However, for remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, multi-temporal observations are often unavailable.In this letter, we take advantage of deep representation learning from convolutional neural networks and propose Deep Feature Gaussian Processes (DFGP) for single-scene AOD reconstruction.By using deep learning, we transform the variables to a feature space with better explainable power.By using Gaussian processes, we explicitly consider the correlation between observed AOD and missing AOD in spatial and feature domains.Experiments on two AOD datasets with real-world cloud patterns showed that the proposed method outperformed deep CNN and random forest, achieving R$^2$ of 0.7431 on MODIS AOD and R$^2$ of 0.9211 on EMIT AOD, compared to deep CNN's R$^2$ of 0.6507 and R$^2$ of 0.8619.The proposed methods increased R$^2$ by over 0.35 compared to the popular random forest in AOD reconstruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code used in this study are available at \url{https://skrisliu.com/dfgp}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to obtain 3D fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene and is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving.Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources.To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features.We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics.We then propose an efficient Gaussian-to-voxel splatting method to generate 3D occupancy predictions, which only aggregates the neighboring Gaussians for a certain position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianFormer achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods with only 17.8% - 24.8% of their memory consumption.Code is available at: https://github.com/huang-yh/GaussianFormer.</p>

                  <p>Generating personalized 3D avatars is crucial for AR/VR.However, recent text-to-3D methods that generate avatars for celebrities or fictional characters, struggle with everyday people.Methods for faithful reconstruction typically require full-body images in controlled settings.What if a user could just upload their personal "OOTD" (Outfit Of The Day) photo collection and get a faithful avatar in return?The challenge is that such casual photo collections contain diverse poses, challenging viewpoints, cropped views, and occlusion (albeit with a consistent outfit, accessories and hairstyle).We address this novel "Album2Human" task by developing PuzzleAvatar, a novel model that generates a faithful 3D avatar (in a canonical pose) from a personal OOTD album, while bypassing the challenging estimation of body and camera pose.To this end, we fine-tune a foundational vision-language model (VLM) on such photos, encoding the appearance, identity, garments, hairstyles, and accessories of a person into (separate) learned tokens and instilling these cues into the VLM.In effect, we exploit the learned tokens as "puzzle pieces" from which we assemble a faithful, personalized 3D avatar.Importantly, we can customize avatars by simply inter-changing tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a benchmark for this new task, we collect a new dataset, called PuzzleIOI, with 41 subjects in a total of nearly 1K OOTD configurations, in challenging partial photos with paired ground-truth 3D bodies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>Evaluation shows that PuzzleAvatar not only has high reconstruction accuracy, outperforming TeCH and MVDreamBooth, but also a unique scalability to album photos, and strong robustness.Our model and data will be public.</p>

                  <p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set.However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline.To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers.While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100.Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy.Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever.This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).}Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset.Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and link to datasets are available at https://github.com/yc-song/cmc <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key information from unstructured documents.Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages.In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets.After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples.Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs.Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment.Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin.In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Scientist learn early on how to cite scientific sources to support their claims.Sometimes, however, scientists have challenges determining where a citation should be situated -- or, even worse, fail to cite a source altogether.Automatically detecting sentences that need a citation (i.e., citation worthiness) could solve both of these issues, leading to more robust and well-constructed scientific arguments.Previous researchers have applied machine learning to this task but have used small datasets and models that do not take advantage of recent algorithmic developments such as attention mechanisms in deep learning.We hypothesize that we can develop significantly accurate deep learning architectures that learn from large supervised datasets constructed from open access publications.In this work, we propose a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention mechanism and contextual information to detect sentences that need citations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also produce a new, large dataset (PMOA-CITE) based on PubMed Open Access Subset, which is orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>Our experiments show that our architecture achieves state of the art performance on the standard ACL-ARC dataset ($F_{1}=0.507$) and exhibits high performance ($F_{1}=0.856$) on the new PMOA-CITE.Moreover, we show that it can transfer learning across these datasets.We further use interpretable models to illuminate how specific language is used to promote and inhibit citations.We discover that sections and surrounding sentences are crucial for our improved predictions.We further examined purported mispredictions of the model, and uncovered systematic human mistakes in citation behavior and source data.This opens the door for our model to check documents during pre-submission and pre-archival procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make this new dataset, the code, and a web-based tool available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.937</span></span></p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.This integrated approach yields remarkable results.In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained prominence for their potential in neuromorphic computing and energy-efficient artificial intelligence, yet optimizing them remains a formidable challenge for gradient-based methods due to their discrete, spike-based computation.This paper attempts to tackle the challenges by introducing Cosine Annealing Differential Evolution (CADE), designed to modulate the mutation factor (F) and crossover rate (CR) of differential evolution (DE) for the SNN model, i.e., Spiking Element Wise (SEW) ResNet.Extensive empirical evaluations were conducted to analyze CADE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CADE showed a balance in exploring and exploiting the search space, resulting in accelerated convergence and improved accuracy compared to existing gradient-based and DE-based methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Moreover, an initialization method based on a transfer learning setting was developed, pretraining on a source dataset (i.e., CIFAR-10) and fine-tuning the target dataset (i.e., CIFAR-100), to improve population diversity.It was found to further enhance CADE for SNN.Remarkably, CADE elevates the performance of the highest accuracy SEW model by an additional 0.52 percentage points, underscoring its effectiveness in fine-tuning and enhancing SNNs.These findings emphasize the pivotal role of a scheduler for F and CR adjustment, especially for DE-based SNN.Source Code on Github: https://github.com/Tank-Jiang/CADE4SNN.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning models in satellite onboard enable real-time interpretation of remote sensing images, reducing the need for data transmission to the ground and conserving communication resources.As satellite numbers and observation frequencies increase, the demand for satellite onboard real-time image interpretation grows, highlighting the expanding importance and development of this technology.However, updating the extensive parameters of models deployed on the satellites for spaceborne object detection model is challenging due to the limitations of uplink bandwidth in wireless satellite communications.To address this issue, this paper proposes a method based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning technology with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) module.It involves training low-rank matrix parameters and integrating them with the original model's weight matrix through multiplication and summation, thereby fine-tuning the model parameters to adapt to new data distributions with minimal weight updates.The proposed method combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning with full fine-tuning in the parameter update strategy of the oriented object detection algorithm architecture.This strategy enables model performance improvements close to full fine-tuning effects with minimal parameter updates.In addition, low rank approximation is conducted to pick an optimal rank value for LoRA matrices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>By fine-tuning and updating only 12.4$\%$ of the model's total parameters, it is able to achieve 97$\%$ to 100$\%$ of the performance of full fine-tuning models.Additionally, the reduced number of trainable parameters accelerates model training iterations and enhances the generalization and robustness of the oriented object detection model.The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/fudanxu/LoRA-Det}.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources.Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how.Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links.Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective.The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices.This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT.This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links.We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics.SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), is an extension of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in logistics and transportation.Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers that deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from different locations.Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP such as ridesharing and non-compliance capture.Apart from original objectives like optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness for all parties.Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give up on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts.However, most existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a single side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and utility optimisation concurrently.To this end, we propose a novel framework, a Two-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the genetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to multi-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness.Subsequently, the impact of injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the correlation between any pair of the three objectives are explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video text spotting aims to simultaneously localize, recognize and track text instances in videos.To address the limited recognition capability of end-to-end methods, tracking the zero-shot results of state-of-the-art image text spotters directly can achieve impressive performance.However, owing to the domain gap between different datasets, these methods usually obtain limited tracking trajectories on extreme dataset.Fine-tuning transformer-based text spotters on specific datasets could yield performance enhancements, albeit at the expense of considerable training resources.In this paper, we propose a Language Collaboration and Glyph Perception Model, termed LOGO to enhance the performance of conventional text spotters through the integration of a synergy module.To achieve this goal, a language synergy classifier (LSC) is designed to explicitly discern text instances from background noise in the recognition stage.Specially, the language synergy classifier can output text content or background code based on the legibility of text regions, thus computing language scores.Subsequently, fusion scores are computed by taking the average of detection scores and language scores, and are utilized to re-score the detection results before tracking.By the re-scoring mechanism, the proposed LSC facilitates the detection of low-resolution text instances while filtering out text-like regions.Besides, the glyph supervision and visual position mixture module are proposed to enhance the recognition accuracy of noisy text regions, and acquire more discriminative tracking features, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation.Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples.Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function.In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation.Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution.Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation.Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map.A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements in machine learning techniques have led to significant achievements in various real-world robotic tasks.These tasks heavily rely on fast and energy-efficient inference of deep neural network (DNN) models when deployed on robots.To enhance inference performance, distributed inference has emerged as a promising approach, parallelizing inference across multiple powerful GPU devices in modern data centers using techniques such as data parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.However, when deployed on real-world robots, existing parallel methods fail to provide low inference latency and meet the energy requirements due to the limited bandwidth of robotic IoT. We present Hybrid-Parallel, a high-performance distributed inference system optimized for robotic IoT. Hybrid-Parallel employs a fine-grained approach to parallelize inference at the granularity of local operators within DNN layers (i.e., operators that can be computed independently with the partial input, such as the convolution kernel in the convolution layer).By doing so, Hybrid-Parallel enables different operators of different layers to be computed and transmitted concurrently, and overlap the computation and transmission phases within the same inference task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation demonstrate that Hybrid-Parallel reduces inference time by 14.9% ~41.1% and energy consumption per inference by up to 35.3% compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>The widespread use of mobile devices for all kind of transactions makes necessary reliable and real-time identity authentication, leading to the adoption of face recognition (FR) via the cameras embedded in such devices.Progress of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has provided substantial advances in FR.Nonetheless, the size of state-of-the-art architectures is unsuitable for mobile deployment, since they often encompass hundreds of megabytes and millions of parameters.We address this by studying methods for deep network compression applied to FR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we apply network pruning based on Taylor scores, where less important filters are removed iteratively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>The method is tested on three networks based on the small SqueezeNet (1.24M parameters) and the popular MobileNetv2 (3.5M) and ResNet50 (23.5M) architectures.These have been selected to showcase the method on CNNs with different complexities and sizes.We observe that a substantial percentage of filters can be removed with minimal performance loss.Also, filters with the highest amount of output channels tend to be removed first, suggesting that high-dimensional spaces within popular CNNs are over-dimensionated.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT).However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency.In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models.We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness.In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$.Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity.DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID.We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models.With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.</p>

                  <p>Coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) are gaining traction thanks to their performance and power efficiency.Utilizing CGRAs to accelerate the execution of tight loops holds great potential for achieving significant overall performance gains, as a substantial portion of program execution time is dedicated to tight loops.But loop parallelization using CGRAs is challenging because of loop-carried data dependencies.Traditionally, loop-carried dependencies are handled by spilling dependent values out of the reconfigurable array to a memory medium and then feeding them back to the grid.Spilling the values and feeding them back into the grid imposes additional latencies and logic that impede performance and limit parallelism.   In this paper, we present the Dependency Resolved CGRA (DR-CGRA) architecture that is designed to accelerate the execution of tight loops.DR-CGRA, which is based on a massively-multithreaded CGRA, runs each iteration as a separate CGRA thread and maps loop-carried data dependencies to inter-thread communication inside the grid.This design ensures the passage of data-dependent values across loop iterations without spilling them out of the grid.   The proposed DR-CGRA architecture was evaluated on various SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrated significant performance improvements, with an average speedup ranging from 2.1 to 4.5 and an overall average of 3.1 when compared to state-of-the-art CGRA architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery.Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data.However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection.To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations.We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements.This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection.Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training.Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance.Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>
