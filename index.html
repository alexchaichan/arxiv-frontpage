                  <p>This article proposes a novel Children-Computer Interaction (CCI) approach for the task of age group detection.This approach focuses on the automatic analysis of the time series generated from the interaction of the children with mobile devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we extract a set of 25 time series related to spatial, pressure, and kinematic information of the children interaction while colouring a tree through a pen stylus tablet, a specific test from the large-scale public ChildCIdb database.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>A complete analysis of the proposed approach is carried out using different time series selection techniques to choose the most discriminative ones for the age group detection task: i) a statistical analysis, and ii) an automatic algorithm called Sequential Forward Search (SFS).In addition, different classification algorithms such as Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are studied.Accuracy results over 85% are achieved, outperforming previous approaches in the literature and in more challenging age group conditions.Finally, the approach presented in this study can benefit many children-related applications, for example, towards an age-appropriate environment with the technology.</p>

                  <p>Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment.In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations.The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions.Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background.However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task.Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes.We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models.This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing demand for automatic high-level image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) within images, underscores the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches.These approaches need to harmonize traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced, context-dependent knowledge humans employ to interpret images at intricate semantic levels.In this work, we leverage situated perceptual knowledge of cultural images to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification.We automatically extract perceptual semantic units from images, which we then model and integrate into the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This resource captures situated perceptual semantics gleaned from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Additionally, we enhance the AKG with high-level linguistic frames.We compute KG embeddings and experiment with relative representations and hybrid approaches that fuse these embeddings with visual transformer embeddings.Finally, for interpretability, we conduct posthoc qualitative analyses by examining model similarities with training instances.Our results show that our hybrid KGE-ViT methods outperform existing techniques in AC image classification.The posthoc interpretability analyses reveal the visual transformer's proficiency in capturing pixel-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing more abstract and semantic scene elements.We demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding for AC image classification.This work suggests a strong potential of neuro-symbolic methods for knowledge integration and robust image representation for use in downstream intricate visual comprehension tasks.All the materials and code are available online.</p>

                  <p>Understanding a surgical scene is crucial for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide any intelligent assistance functionality.One way of achieving this scene understanding is via scene segmentation, where every pixel of a frame is classified and therefore identifies the visible structures and tissues.Progress on fully segmenting surgical scenes has been made using machine learning.However, such models require large amounts of annotated training data, containing examples of all relevant object classes.Such fully annotated datasets are hard to create, as every pixel in a frame needs to be annotated by medical experts and, therefore, are rarely available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a method to combine multiple partially annotated datasets, which provide complementary annotations, into one model, enabling better scene segmentation and the use of multiple readily available datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Our method aims to combine available data with complementary labels by leveraging mutual exclusive properties to maximize information.Specifically, we propose to use positive annotations of other classes as negative samples and to exclude background pixels of binary annotations, as we cannot tell if they contain a class not annotated but predicted by the model.We evaluate our method by training a DeepLabV3 on the publicly available Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary segmented anatomical structures.Our approach successfully combines 6 classes into one model, increasing the overall Dice Score by 4.4% compared to an ensemble of models trained on the classes individually.By including information on multiple classes, we were able to reduce confusion between stomach and colon by 24%.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training a model on multiple datasets.This paves the way for future work further alleviating the need for one large, fully segmented datasets.</p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a new distance oracle in the fully dynamic setting: given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and an arbitrary parameter $\epsilon$ where $1/\log^{c} n<\epsilon<1$ and $c>0$ is a small constant, we can deterministically maintain a data structure with $n^{\epsilon}$ worst-case update time that, given any pair of vertices $(u,v)$, returns a $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}$-approximate distance between $u$ and $v$ in ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)\log\log n$ query time.   Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms.First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time.Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time.The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang[STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.

                  <p>Adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (ARAG) aims to dynamically determine the necessity of retrieval for queries instead of retrieving indiscriminately to enhance the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information.However, previous works largely overlook the evaluation of ARAG approaches, leading to their effectiveness being understudied.This work presents a benchmark, RetrievalQA, comprising 1,271 short-form questions covering new world and long-tail knowledge.The knowledge necessary to answer the questions is absent from LLMs; therefore, external information must be retrieved to answer correctly.This makes RetrievalQA a suitable testbed to evaluate existing ARAG methods.We observe that calibration-based methods heavily rely on threshold tuning, while vanilla prompting is inadequate for guiding LLMs to make reliable retrieval decisions.Based on our findings, we propose Time-Aware Adaptive Retrieval (TA-ARE), a simple yet effective method that helps LLMs assess the necessity of retrieval without calibration or additional training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be available at \url{https://github.com/hyintell/RetrievalQA} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that facilitates collaborative training of a shared global model across devices while keeping data localized.The deployment of FL in numerous real-world applications faces delays, primarily due to the prevalent reliance on supervised tasks.Generating detailed labels at edge devices, if feasible, is demanding, given resource constraints and the imperative for continuous data updates.In addressing these challenges, solutions such as federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL), which relies on unlabeled clients' data and a limited amount of labeled data on the server, become pivotal.In this paper, we propose FedAnchor, an innovative FSSL method that introduces a unique double-head structure, called anchor head, paired with the classification head trained exclusively on labeled anchor data on the server.The anchor head is empowered with a newly designed label contrastive loss based on the cosine similarity metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach mitigates the confirmation bias and overfitting issues associated with pseudo-labeling techniques based on high-confidence model prediction samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Extensive experiments on CIFAR10/100 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a significant margin in terms of convergence rate and model accuracy.</p>

A complete analysis of the proposed approach is carried out using different time series selection techniques to choose the most discriminative ones for the age group detection task: i) a statistical analysis, and ii) an automatic algorithm called Sequential Forward Search (SFS).In addition, different classification algorithms such as Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are studied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Accuracy results over 85% are achieved, outperforming previous approaches in the literature and in more challenging age group conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Finally, the approach presented in this study can benefit many children-related applications, for example, towards an age-appropriate environment with the technology.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLMs has ignited a fresh surge of breakthroughs in NLP applications, particularly in domains such as question-answering systems and text generation.As the need for longer context grows, a significant bottleneck in model deployment emerges due to the linear expansion of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the context length.Existing methods primarily rely on various hypotheses, such as sorting the KV cache based on attention scores for replacement or eviction, to compress the KV cache and improve model throughput.However, heuristics used by these strategies may wrongly evict essential KV cache, which can significantly degrade model performance.In this paper, we propose QAQ, a Quality Adaptive Quantization scheme for the KV cache.We theoretically demonstrate that key cache and value cache exhibit distinct sensitivities to quantization, leading to the formulation of separate quantization strategies for their non-uniform quantization.Through the integration of dedicated outlier handling, as well as an improved attention-aware approach, QAQ achieves up to 10x the compression ratio of the KV cache size with a neglectable impact on model performance.QAQ significantly reduces the practical hurdles of deploying LLMs, opening up new possibilities for longer-context applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is available at github.com/ClubieDong/KVCacheQuantization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have revealed that federated learning (FL), once considered secure due to clients not sharing their private data with the server, is vulnerable to attacks such as client-side training data distribution inference, where a malicious client can recreate the victim's data.While various countermeasures exist, they are not practical, often assuming server access to some training data or knowledge of label distribution before the attack.   In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing InferGuard, a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation rule aimed at defending against client-side training data distribution inference attacks.In our proposed InferGuard, the server first calculates the coordinate-wise median of all the model updates it receives.A client's model update is considered malicious if it significantly deviates from the computed median update.We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed InferGuard on five benchmark datasets and perform a comparison with ten baseline methods.The results of our experiments indicate that our defense mechanism is highly effective in protecting against client-side training data distribution inference attacks, even against strong adaptive attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our method substantially outperforms the baseline methods in various practical FL scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTA) is a challenging task that aims to adapt a source pre-trained model to continually changing target domains.In the CTA setting, a model does not know when the target domain changes, thus facing a drastic change in the distribution of streaming inputs during the test-time.The key challenge is to keep adapting the model to the continually changing target domains in an online manner.We find that a model shows highly biased predictions as it constantly adapts to the chaining distribution of the target data.It predicts certain classes more often than other classes, making inaccurate over-confident predictions.This paper mitigates this issue to improve performance in the CTA scenario.To alleviate the bias issue, we make class-wise exponential moving average target prototypes with reliable target samples and exploit them to cluster the target features class-wisely.Moreover, we aim to align the target distributions to the source distribution by anchoring the target feature to its corresponding source prototype.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With extensive experiments, our proposed method achieves noteworthy performance gain when applied on top of existing CTA methods without substantial adaptation time overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems against presentation attacks.With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques, many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged.However, they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions.These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability, where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments, leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion, and (2) modality imbalance, where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others, reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable sorely using the dominant modality.To address modality unreliability, we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities.For modality imbalance, we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients.Besides, we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Source code and protocols will be released on https://github.com/OMGGGGG/mmdg.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing multimedia information, multimodal recommendation has received extensive attention.It utilizes multimodal information to alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, thus improving recommendation accuracy.However, the reliance on labeled data severely limits the performance of multimodal recommendation models.Recently, self-supervised learning has been used in multimodal recommendations to mitigate the label sparsity problem.Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods cannot avoid the modality noise when aligning multimodal information due to the large differences in the distributions of different modalities.To this end, we propose a Multi-level sElf-supervised learNing for mulTimOdal Recommendation (MENTOR) method to address the label sparsity problem and the modality alignment problem.Specifically, MENTOR first enhances the specific features of each modality using the graph convolutional network (GCN) and fuses the visual and textual modalities.It then enhances the item representation via the item semantic graph for all modalities, including the fused modality.Then, it introduces two multilevel self-supervised tasks: the multilevel cross-modal alignment task and the general feature enhancement task.The multilevel cross-modal alignment task aligns each modality under the guidance of the ID embedding from multiple levels while maintaining the historical interaction information.The general feature enhancement task enhances the general feature from both the graph and feature perspectives to improve the robustness of our model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/MENTOR.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation.However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs.However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs.This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task.To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements.Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks.Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask.Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation.To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%.On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%.</p>

To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations.Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>
