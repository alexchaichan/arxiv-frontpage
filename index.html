                  <p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market.Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems.Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system.However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration.Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model.This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT).FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation.Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT.In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the source codes and datasets can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/FE-GUT/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced in conditional image generation.However, these models usually struggle with accurately rendering images featuring humans, resulting in distorted limbs and other anomalies.This issue primarily stems from the insufficient recognition and evaluation of limb qualities in diffusion models.To address this issue, we introduce AbHuman, the first large-scale synthesized human benchmark focusing on anatomical anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark consists of 56K synthesized human images, each annotated with detailed, bounding-box level labels identifying 147K human anomalies in 18 different categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.955</span></span>Based on this, the recognition of human anomalies can be established, which in turn enhances image generation through traditional techniques such as negative prompting and guidance.To further boost the improvement, we propose HumanRefiner, a novel plug-and-play approach for the coarse-to-fine refinement of human anomalies in text-to-image generation.Specifically, HumanRefiner utilizes a self-diagnostic procedure to detect and correct issues related to both coarse-grained abnormal human poses and fine-grained anomaly levels, facilitating pose-reversible diffusion generation.Experimental results on the AbHuman benchmark demonstrate that HumanRefiner significantly reduces generative discrepancies, achieving a 2.9x improvement in limb quality compared to the state-of-the-art open-source generator SDXL and a 1.4x improvement over DALL-E 3 in human evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Enderfga/HumanRefiner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) simplifies querying vast amounts of knowledge stored in a graph-based model using natural language.However, the research has largely concentrated on English, putting non-English speakers at a disadvantage.Meanwhile, existing multilingual KGQA systems face challenges in achieving performance comparable to English systems, highlighting the difficulty of generating SPARQL queries from diverse languages.In this research, we propose a simplified approach to enhance multilingual KGQA systems by incorporating linguistic context and entity information directly into the processing pipeline of a language model.Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoders for integrating auxiliary information, our strategy leverages a single, pretrained multilingual transformer-based language model to manage both the primary input and the auxiliary data.Our methodology significantly improves the language model's ability to accurately convert a natural language query into a relevant SPARQL query.It demonstrates promising results on the most recent QALD datasets, namely QALD-9-Plus and QALD-10.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate our approach on Chinese and Japanese, thereby expanding the language diversity of the existing datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn a model that can not only incrementally accommodate new classes, but also maintain the learned knowledge of old classes.Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in CIL is to retain this incremental learning ability, while being able to reject unknown samples that are drawn from different distributions of the learned classes.This capability is crucial to the safety of deploying CIL models in open worlds.However, despite remarkable advancements in the respective CIL and OOD detection, there lacks a systematic and large-scale benchmark to assess the capability of advanced CIL models in detecting OOD samples.To fill this gap, in this study we design a comprehensive empirical study to establish such a benchmark, named $\textbf{OpenCIL}$. To this end, we propose two principled frameworks for enabling four representative CIL models with 15 diverse OOD detection methods, resulting in 60 baseline models for OOD detection in CIL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical evaluation is performed on two popular CIL datasets with six commonly-used OOD datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>One key observation we find through our comprehensive evaluation is that the CIL models can be severely biased towards the OOD samples and newly added classes when they are exposed to open environments.Motivated by this, we further propose a new baseline for OOD detection in CIL, namely Bi-directional Energy Regularization ($\textbf{BER}$), which is specially designed to mitigate these two biases in different CIL models by having energy regularization on both old and new classes.Its superior performance is justified in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All codes and datasets are open-source at $https://github.com/mala-lab/OpenCIL$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>Amid the rising intersection of generative AI and human artistic processes, this study probes the critical yet less-explored terrain of alignment in human-centric automatic song composition.We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions.This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms.Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions.Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results.Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation.This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results.MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation.The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.</p>

                  <p>Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning.One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs.Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation.However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data.This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs.To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert.This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning.The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%.We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems.One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL).While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges.First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner.This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task.Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task.To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks.We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity.For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, most of the hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion experiments are based on simulated datasets to compare different fusion methods.However, most of the spectral response functions and spatial downsampling functions used to create the simulated datasets are not entirely accurate, resulting in deviations in spatial and spectral features between the generated images for fusion and the real images for fusion.This reduces the credibility of the fusion algorithm, causing unfairness in the comparison between different algorithms and hindering the development of the field of hyperspectral image fusion.Therefore, we release a real HSI/MSI/PAN image dataset to promote the development of the field of hyperspectral image fusion.These three images are spatially registered, meaning fusion can be performed between HSI and MSI, HSI and PAN image, MSI and PAN image, as well as among HSI, MSI, and PAN image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This real dataset could be available at https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/281612. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.931</span></span>The related code to process the data could be available at https://github.com/rs-lsl/CSSNet.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant advancements to code generation and code repair, benefiting both novice and experienced developers.However, their training using unsanitized data from open-source repositories, like GitHub, raises the risk of inadvertently propagating security vulnerabilities.Despite numerous studies investigating the safety of code LLMs, there remains a gap in comprehensively addressing their security features.In this work, we aim to present a comprehensive study aimed at precisely evaluating and enhancing the security aspects of code LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support our research, we introduce CodeSecEval, a meticulously curated dataset designed to address 44 critical vulnerability types with 180 distinct samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>CodeSecEval serves as the foundation for the automatic evaluation of code models in two crucial tasks: code generation and code repair, with a strong emphasis on security.Our experimental results reveal that current models frequently overlook security issues during both code generation and repair processes, resulting in the creation of vulnerable code.In response, we propose different strategies that leverage vulnerability-aware information and insecure code explanations to mitigate these security vulnerabilities.Furthermore, our findings highlight that certain vulnerability types particularly challenge model performance, influencing their effectiveness in real-world applications.Based on these findings, we believe our study will have a positive impact on the software engineering community, inspiring the development of improved methods for training and utilizing LLMs, thereby leading to safer and more trustworthy model deployment.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>Existing open-set recognition (OSR) studies typically assume that each image contains only one class label, and the unknown test set (negative) has a disjoint label space from the known test set (positive), a scenario termed full-label shift.This paper introduces the mixed OSR problem, where test images contain multiple class semantics, with known and unknown classes co-occurring in negatives, leading to a more challenging super-label shift.Addressing the mixed OSR requires classification models to accurately distinguish different class semantics within images and measure their "knowness".In this study, we propose the OpenSlot framework, built upon object-centric learning.OpenSlot utilizes slot features to represent diverse class semantics and produce class predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our proposed anti-noise-slot (ANS) technique, we mitigate the impact of noise (invalid and background) slots during classification training, effectively addressing the semantic misalignment between class predictions and the ground truth. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments with OpenSlot on mixed & conventional OSR benchmarks.Without elaborate designs, OpenSlot not only exceeds existing OSR studies in detecting super-label shifts across single & multi-label mixed OSR tasks but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional benchmarks.Remarkably, our method can localize class objects without using bounding boxes during training.The competitive performance in open-set object detection demonstrates OpenSlot's ability to explicitly explain label shifts and benefits in computational efficiency and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups.Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry.However, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm.This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary.In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation (a spherical parametrization) for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation.Namely, we show how to construct the normals and the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, and how to compute the surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface.These operators, in turn, enable us to create geometry processing tools that act directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing.We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and our method shows robustness to isometric shape variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We both propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing.</p>

                  <p>Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has wide applications in human-machine interaction scenarios, such as digitized education and automated offices.Recently, sequence-based models with encoder-decoder architectures have been commonly adopted to address this task by directly predicting LaTeX sequences of expression images.However, these methods only implicitly learn the syntax rules provided by LaTeX, which may fail to describe the position and hierarchical relationship between symbols due to complex structural relations and diverse handwriting styles.To overcome this challenge, we propose a position forest transformer (PosFormer) for HMER, which jointly optimizes two tasks: expression recognition and position recognition, to explicitly enable position-aware symbol feature representation learning.Specifically, we first design a position forest that models the mathematical expression as a forest structure and parses the relative position relationships between symbols.Without requiring extra annotations, each symbol is assigned a position identifier in the forest to denote its relative spatial position.Second, we propose an implicit attention correction module to accurately capture attention for HMER in the sequence-based decoder architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PosFormer, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods 2.03%/1.22%/2.00%, 1.83%, and 4.62% gains on the single-line CROHME 2014/2016/2019, multi-line M2E, and complex MNE datasets, respectively, with no additional latency or computational cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/SJTU-DeepVisionLab/PosFormer.</p>

                  <p>The approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental and essential component in information retrieval, with graph-based methodologies demonstrating superior performance compared to alternative approaches.Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to improving search efficiency by developing various graph-based indices, such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World).However, the performance of HNSW and most graph-based indices becomes unacceptable when faced with a large number of real-time deletions, insertions, and updates.Furthermore, during update operations, HNSW can result in some data points becoming unreachable, a situation we refer to as the `unreachable points phenomenon'.This phenomenon could significantly affect the search accuracy of the graph in certain situations.   To address these issues, we present efficient measures to overcome the shortcomings of HNSW, specifically addressing poor performance over long periods of delete and update operations and resolving the issues caused by the unreachable points phenomenon.Our proposed MN-RU algorithm effectively improves update efficiency and suppresses the growth rate of unreachable points, ensuring better overall performance and maintaining the integrity of the graph.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Furthermore, since our methods are based on HNSW, they can be easily integrated with existing indices widely used in the industrial field, making them practical for future real-world applications.Code is available at https://github.com/xwt1/ICPADS-MN-RU.git</p>

                  <p>A dynamic graph algorithm is a data structure that supports edge insertions, deletions, and specific problem queries.While extensive research exists on dynamic algorithms for graph problems solvable in polynomial time, most of these algorithms have not been implemented or empirically evaluated.   This work addresses the NP-complete maximum weight and cardinality independent set problems in a dynamic setting, applicable to areas like dynamic map-labeling and vehicle routing.Real-world instances can be vast, with millions of vertices and edges, making it challenging to find near-optimal solutions quickly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exact solvers can find optimal solutions but have exponential worst-case runtimes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Conversely, heuristic algorithms use local search techniques to improve solutions by optimizing vertices.   In this work, we introduce a novel local search technique called optimal neighborhood exploration.This technique creates independent subproblems that are solved to optimality, leading to improved overall solutions.Through numerous experiments, we assess the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art dynamic solvers.Our algorithm features a parameter, the subproblem size, that balances running time and solution quality.With this parameter, our configuration matches state-of-the-art performance for the cardinality independent set problem.By increasing the parameter, we significantly enhance solution quality.</p>

                  <p>FPGAs offer a flexible platform for accelerating deep neural network (DNN) inference, particularly for non-uniform workloads featuring fine-grained unstructured sparsity and mixed arithmetic precision.To leverage these redundancies, an emerging approach involves partially or fully unrolling computations for each DNN layer.That way, parameter-level and bit-level ineffectual operations can be completely skipped, thus saving the associated area and power.Regardless, unrolled implementations scale poorly and limit the size of a DNN that can be unrolled on an FPGA.This motivates the investigation of new reconfigurable architectures to improve the efficiency of unrolled DNNs, while taking advantage of sparsity and mixed precision.To enable this, we present Kratos: a focused FPGA benchmark of unrolled DNN primitives with varying levels of sparsity and different arithmetic precisions.Our analysis reveals that unrolled DNNs can operate at very high frequencies, reaching the maximum frequency limit of an Arria 10 device.Additionally, we found that substantial area reductions can be achieved through fine-grained sparsity and low bit-width.We build on those results to tailor the FPGA fabric for unrolled DNNs through an architectural case study demonstrating $\sim$2$\times$ area reduction when using smaller LUT sizes within current FPGAs.This paves the way for further exploration of new programmable architectures that are purpose-built for sparse and low-precision unrolled DNNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and benchmark are available on github.com/abdelfattah-lab/Kratos-benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span></p>

                  <p>Crowd counting is gaining societal relevance, particularly in domains of Urban Planning, Crowd Management, and Public Safety.This paper introduces Fourier-guided attention (FGA), a novel attention mechanism for crowd count estimation designed to address the inefficient full-scale global pattern capture in existing works on convolution-based attention networks.FGA efficiently captures multi-scale information, including full-scale global patterns, by utilizing Fast-Fourier Transformations (FFT) along with spatial attention for global features and convolutions with channel-wise attention for semi-global and local features.The architecture of FGA involves a dual-path approach: (1) a path for processing full-scale global features through FFT, allowing for efficient extraction of information in the frequency domain, and (2) a path for processing remaining feature maps for semi-global and local features using traditional convolutions and channel-wise attention.This dual-path architecture enables FGA to seamlessly integrate frequency and spatial information, enhancing its ability to capture diverse crowd patterns.We apply FGA in the last layers of two popular crowd-counting works, CSRNet and CANNet, to evaluate the module's performance on benchmark datasets such as ShanghaiTech-A, ShanghaiTech-B, UCF-CC-50, and JHU++ crowd.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate a notable improvement across all datasets based on Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) metrics, showing comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Additionally, we illustrate the interpretability using qualitative analysis, leveraging Grad-CAM heatmaps, to show the effectiveness of FGA in capturing crowd patterns.</p>

                  <p>Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge.For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality.These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters.Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience.To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty.Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays.However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties.We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in predicting 6D grasp poses from a single depth image have led to promising performance in robotic grasping.However, previous grasping models face challenges in cluttered environments where nearby objects impact the target object's grasp.In this paper, we first establish a new benchmark dataset for TARget-driven Grasping under Occlusions, named TARGO.We make the following contributions: 1) We are the first to study the occlusion level of grasping.2) We set up an evaluation benchmark consisting of large-scale synthetic data and part of real-world data, and we evaluated five grasp models and found that even the current SOTA model suffers when the occlusion level increases, leaving grasping under occlusion still a challenge.3) We also generate a large-scale training dataset via a scalable pipeline, which can be used to boost the performance of grasping under occlusion and generalized to the real world.4) We further propose a transformer-based grasping model involving a shape completion module, termed TARGO-Net, which performs most robustly as occlusion increases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark dataset can be found at https://TARGO-benchmark.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>Objects in aerial images are typically embedded in complex backgrounds and exhibit arbitrary orientations.When employing oriented bounding boxes (OBB) to represent arbitrary oriented objects, the periodicity of angles could lead to discontinuities in label regression values at the boundaries, inducing abrupt fluctuations in the loss function.To address this problem, an OBB representation based on the complex plane is introduced in the oriented detection framework, and a trigonometric loss function is proposed.Moreover, leveraging prior knowledge of complex background environments and significant differences in large objects in aerial images, a conformer RPN head is constructed to predict angle information.The proposed loss function and conformer RPN head jointly generate high-quality oriented proposals.A category-aware dynamic label assignment based on predicted category feedback is proposed to address the limitations of solely relying on IoU for proposal label assignment.This method makes negative sample selection more representative, ensuring consistency between classification and regression features.Experiments were conducted on four realistic oriented detection datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in oriented object detection with minimal parameter tuning and time costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, mean average precision (mAP) scores of 82.02%, 71.99%, 69.87%, and 98.77% were achieved on the DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, DIOR-R, and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unlike Object Detection, Visual Grounding task necessitates the detection of an object described by complex free-form language.To simultaneously model such complex semantic and visual representations, recent state-of-the-art studies adopt transformer-based models to fuse features from both modalities, further introducing various modules that modulate visual features to align with the language expressions and eliminate the irrelevant redundant information.However, their loss function, still adopting common Object Detection losses, solely governs the bounding box regression output, failing to fully optimize for the above objectives.To tackle this problem, in this paper, we first analyze the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models.Building upon this, we further propose a novel framework named Attention-Driven Constraint Balancing (AttBalance) to optimize the behavior of visual features within language-relevant regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results show that our method brings impressive improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we achieve constant improvements over five different models evaluated on four different benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Moreover, we attain a new state-of-the-art performance by integrating our method into QRNet.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data.The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts.Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -- specifically large language models (LLMs) -- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs.Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications.However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.   In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

                  <p>We investigate practical and scalable algorithms for training large language models (LLMs) with user-level differential privacy (DP) in order to provably safeguard all the examples contributed by each user.We study two variants of DP-SGD with: (1) example-level sampling (ELS) and per-example gradient clipping, and (2) user-level sampling (ULS) and per-user gradient clipping.We derive a novel user-level DP accountant that allows us to compute provably tight privacy guarantees for ELS.Using this, we show that while ELS can outperform ULS in specific settings, ULS generally yields better results when each user has a diverse collection of examples.We validate our findings through experiments in synthetic mean estimation and LLM fine-tuning tasks under fixed compute budgets.We find that ULS is significantly better in settings where either (1) strong privacy guarantees are required, or (2) the compute budget is large.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our focus on LLM-compatible training algorithms allows us to scale to models with hundreds of millions of parameters and datasets with hundreds of thousands of users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model training requires significantly more memory, compared with inference.Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods provide a means of adapting large models to downstream tasks using less memory.However, existing methods such as adapters, prompt tuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) either introduce latency overhead at inference time or achieve subpar downstream performance compared with full fine-tuning.In this work we propose Random Subspace Adaptation (ROSA), a method that outperforms previous PEFT methods by a significant margin, while maintaining a zero latency overhead during inference time.In contrast to previous methods, ROSA is able to adapt subspaces of arbitrarily large dimension, better approximating full-finetuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that this makes ROSA strictly more expressive than LoRA, without consuming additional memory during runtime. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>As PEFT methods are especially useful in the natural language processing domain, where models operate on scales that make full fine-tuning very expensive, we evaluate ROSA in two common NLP scenarios: natural language generation (NLG) and natural language understanding (NLU) with GPT-2 and RoBERTa, respectively.We show that on almost every GLUE task ROSA outperforms LoRA by a significant margin, while also outperforming LoRA on NLG tasks.Our code is available at https://github.com/rosa-paper/rosa</p>

To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>
