                  <p>Recently, many versatile Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged continuously.However, their capacity to query information depicted in visual charts and engage in reasoning based on the queried contents remains under-explored.In this paper, to comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the ability of the off-the-shelf MLLMs in the chart domain, we construct ChartX, a multi-modal evaluation set covering 18 chart types, 7 chart tasks, 22 disciplinary topics, and high-quality chart data.Besides, we develop ChartVLM to offer a new perspective on handling multi-modal tasks that strongly depend on interpretable patterns, such as reasoning tasks in the field of charts or geometric images.We evaluate the chart-related ability of mainstream MLLMs and our ChartVLM on the proposed ChartX evaluation set.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChartVLM surpasses both versatile and chart-related large models, achieving results comparable to GPT-4V. We believe that our study can pave the way for further exploration in creating a more comprehensive chart evaluation set and developing more interpretable multi-modal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both ChartX and ChartVLM are available at: https://github.com/UniModal4Reasoning/ChartVLM <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span></p>

                  <p>Natural language and search interfaces intuitively facilitate data exploration and provide visualization responses to diverse analytical queries based on the underlying datasets.However, these interfaces often fail to interpret more complex analytical intents, such as discerning subtleties and quantifiable differences between terms like "bump" and "spike" in the context of COVID cases, for example.We address this gap by extending the capabilities of a data exploration search interface for interpreting semantic concepts in time series trends.We first create a comprehensive dataset of semantic concepts by mapping quantifiable univariate data trends such as slope and angle to crowdsourced, semantically meaningful trend labels.The dataset contains quantifiable properties that capture the slope-scalar effect of semantic modifiers like "sharply" and "gradually," as well as multi-line trends (e.g., "peak," "valley").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the utility of this dataset in SlopeSeeker, a tool that supports natural language querying of quantifiable trends, such as "show me stocks that tanked in 2010." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>The tool incorporates novel scoring and ranking techniques based on semantic relevance and visual prominence to present relevant trend chart responses containing these semantic trend concepts.In addition, SlopeSeeker provides a faceted search interface for users to navigate a semantic hierarchy of concepts from general trends (e.g., "increase") to more specific ones (e.g., "sharp increase").A preliminary user evaluation of the tool demonstrates that the search interface supports greater expressivity of queries containing concepts that describe data trends.We identify potential future directions for leveraging our publicly available quantitative semantics dataset in other data domains and for novel visual analytics interfaces.</p>

                  <p>Auto-regressive models have achieved impressive results in 2D image generation by modeling joint distributions in grid space.In this paper, we extend auto-regressive models to 3D domains, and seek a stronger ability of 3D shape generation by improving auto-regressive models at capacity and scalability simultaneously.Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly available 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It consists of a comprehensive collection of approximately 900,000 objects, with multiple properties of meshes, points, voxels, rendered images, and text captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>This diverse labeled dataset, termed Objaverse-Mix, empowers our model to learn from a wide range of object variations.However, directly applying 3D auto-regression encounters critical challenges of high computational demands on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions, resulting in inferior quality of 3D shapes.To this end, we then present a novel framework Argus3D in terms of capacity.Concretely, our approach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions in a more tractable order.The capacity of conditional generation can thus be realized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent vector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts.In addition, thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our approach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further enhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation.Extensive experiments on four generation tasks demonstrate that Argus3D can synthesize diverse and faithful shapes across multiple categories, achieving remarkable performance.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational context.Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships.However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic.This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities.The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le\'on, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020.The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data.The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures.The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection.The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection.The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network.Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>Food computing brings various perspectives to computer vision like vision-based food analysis for nutrition and health.As a fundamental task in food computing, food detection needs Zero-Shot Detection (ZSD) on novel unseen food objects to support real-world scenarios, such as intelligent kitchens and smart restaurants.Therefore, we first benchmark the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) by introducing FOWA dataset with rich attribute annotations.Unlike ZSD, fine-grained problems in ZSFD like inter-class similarity make synthesized features inseparable.The complexity of food semantic attributes further makes it more difficult for current ZSD methods to distinguish various food categories.To address these problems, we propose a novel framework ZSFDet to tackle fine-grained problems by exploiting the interaction between complex attributes.Specifically, we model the correlation between food categories and attributes in ZSFDet by multi-source graphs to provide prior knowledge for distinguishing fine-grained features.Within ZSFDet, Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) learns knowledge representation from multiple sources (e.g., ingredients correlation from knowledge graph) via the multi-source graph fusion.Conditioned on the fusion of semantic knowledge representation, the region feature diffusion model in KEFS can generate fine-grained features for training the effective zero-shot detector.Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method ZSFDet on FOWA and the widely-used food dataset UECFOOD-256, with significant improvements by 1.8% and 3.7% ZSD mAP compared with the strong baseline RRFS.Further experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO prove that enhancement of the semantic knowledge can also improve the performance on general ZSD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/KEFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have centered around a handful of data-rich languages.What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first-class citizen languages?Our work introduces Aya, a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 50% are considered as lower-resourced.Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages.We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state-of-art for multilingual eval across 99 languages -- including discriminative and generative tasks, human evaluation, and simulated win rates that cover both held-out tasks and in-distribution performance.Furthermore, we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition, data pruning, as well as the toxicity, bias, and safety of our models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source our instruction datasets and our model at https://hf.co/CohereForAI/aya-101 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models are now capable of solving tasks that require dealing with long sequences consisting of hundreds of thousands of tokens.However, they often fail on tasks that require repetitive use of simple rules, even on sequences that are much shorter than those seen during training.For example, state-of-the-art LLMs can find common items in two lists with up to 20 items but fail when lists have 80 items.In this paper, we introduce Lissard, a benchmark comprising seven tasks whose goal is to assess the ability of models to process and generate wide-range sequence lengths, requiring repetitive procedural execution.Our evaluation of open-source (Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8x7B) and proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) show a consistent decline in performance across all models as the complexity of the sequence increases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code are available at https://github.com/unicamp-dl/Lissard <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>The fairness-aware online learning framework has emerged as a potent tool within the context of continuous lifelong learning.In this scenario, the learner's objective is to progressively acquire new tasks as they arrive over time, while also guaranteeing statistical parity among various protected sub-populations, such as race and gender, when it comes to the newly introduced tasks.A significant limitation of current approaches lies in their heavy reliance on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption concerning data, leading to a static regret analysis of the framework.Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that achieving low static regret does not necessarily translate to strong performance in dynamic environments characterized by tasks sampled from diverse distributions.In this paper, to tackle the fairness-aware online learning challenge in evolving settings, we introduce a unique regret measure, FairSAR, by incorporating long-term fairness constraints into a strongly adapted loss regret framework.Moreover, to determine an optimal model parameter at each time step, we introduce an innovative adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, referred to as FairSAOML.This algorithm possesses the ability to adjust to dynamic environments by effectively managing bias control and model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The problem is framed as a bi-level convex-concave optimization, considering both the model's primal and dual parameters, which pertain to its accuracy and fairness attributes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Theoretical analysis yields sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and the cumulative violation of fairness constraints.Our experimental evaluation on various real-world datasets in dynamic environments demonstrates that our proposed FairSAOML algorithm consistently outperforms alternative approaches rooted in the most advanced prior online learning methods.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: We apply federated learning to train an OCT image classifier simulating a realistic scenario with multiple clients and statistical heterogeneous data distribution where data in the clients lack samples of some categories entirely.   Methods: We investigate the effectiveness of FedAvg and FedProx to train an OCT image classification model in a decentralized fashion, addressing privacy concerns associated with centralizing data.We partitioned a publicly available OCT dataset across multiple clients under IID and Non-IID settings and conducted local training on the subsets for each client.We evaluated two federated learning methods, FedAvg and FedProx for these settings.   Results: Our experiments on the dataset suggest that under IID settings, both methods perform on par with training on a central data pool.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the performance of both algorithms declines as we increase the statistical heterogeneity across the client data, while FedProx consistently performs better than FedAvg in the increased heterogeneity settings.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Conclusion: Despite the effectiveness of federated learning in the utilization of private data across multiple medical institutions, the large number of clients and heterogeneous distribution of labels deteriorate the performance of both algorithms.Notably, FedProx appears to be more robust to the increased heterogeneity.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been extensively employed to align large language models with user intent.However, proximal policy optimization (PPO) based RLHF is occasionally unstable requiring significant hyperparameter finetuning, and computationally expensive to maximize the estimated reward during alignment.Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges.However, DPO relies on contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM, instead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF.In this paper, we addresses both challenges by systematically combining rejection sampling (RS) and DPO.Our proposed method, RS-DPO, initiates with the development of a supervised fine-tuned policy model (SFT).A varied set of k responses per prompt are sampled directly from the SFT model.RS-DPO identifies pairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution.Finally, we apply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference.Our experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs with limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user intent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods, including RS, PPO, and DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Countries worldwide have been implementing different actions national strategies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to shape policy priorities and guide their development concerning AI.Several AI indices have emerged to assess countries' progress in AI development, aiding decision-making on investments and policy choices.Typically, these indices combine multiple indicators using linear additive methods such as weighted sums, although they are limited in their ability to account for interactions among indicators.Another limitation concerns the use of deterministic weights, which can be perceived as subjective and vulnerable to debate and scrutiny, especially by nations that feel disadvantaged.Aiming at mitigating these problems, we conduct a methodological analysis to derive AI indices based on multiple criteria decision analysis.Initially, we assess correlations between different AI dimensions and employ the Choquet integral to model them.Thus, we apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to conduct a sensitivity analysis using both weighted sum and Choquet integral in order to evaluate the stability of the indices with regard the weights.Finally, we introduce a novel ranking methodology based on SMAA, which considers several sets of weights to derive the ranking of countries.As a result, instead of using predefined weights, in the proposed approach, the ranking is achieved based on the probabilities of countries in occupying a specific position.In the computational analysis, we utilize the data employed in The Global AI Index proposed by Tortoise.Results reveal correlations in the data, and our approach effectively mitigates bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the sensitivity analysis, we scrutinize changes in the ranking resulting from weight adjustments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our proposal rankings closely align with those derived from weight variations, proving to be more robust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given a network, allocating resources at clusters level, rather than at each node, enhances efficiency in resource allocation and usage.In this paper, we study the problem of finding fully connected disjoint clusters to minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the number of nodes assigned to the clusters, while also ensuring that no two nodes within a cluster exceed a threshold distance.While the problem can easily be formulated using a binary linear model, traditional combinatorial optimization solvers struggle when dealing with large-scale instances.We propose an approach to solve this constrained clustering problem via reinforcement learning.Our method involves training an agent to generate both feasible and (near) optimal solutions.The agent learns problem-specific heuristics, tailored to the instances encountered in this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the results section, we show that our algorithm finds near optimal solutions, even for large scale instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Diffusion Models remains an underexplored frontier in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially when compared with the remarkable progress made in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data.Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images ("winner" and "loser" images) for each text prompt.In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process.Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment.Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Demonstrations are commonly used to speed up the learning process of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.To cope with the difficulty of accessing multiple demonstrations, some algorithms have been developed to learn from a single demonstration.In particular, the Divide & Conquer Imitation Learning algorithms leverage a sequential bias to learn a control policy for complex robotic tasks using a single state-based demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The latest version, DCIL-II demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>This novel method operates within an extended Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning framework, ensuring compatibility between intermediate and subsequent goals extracted from the demonstration.However, a fundamental limitation arises from the assumption that the system can be reset to specific states along the demonstrated trajectory, confining the application to simulated systems.In response, we introduce an extension called Single-Reset DCIL (SR-DCIL), designed to overcome this constraint by relying on a single initial state reset rather than sequential resets.To address this more challenging setting, we integrate two mechanisms inspired by the Learning from Demonstrations literature, including a Demo-Buffer and Value Cloning, to guide the agent toward compatible success states.In addition, we introduce Approximate Goal Switching to facilitate training to reach goals distant from the reset state.Our paper makes several contributions, highlighting the importance of the reset assumption in DCIL-II, presenting the mechanisms of SR-DCIL variants and evaluating their performance in challenging robotic tasks compared to DCIL-II.In summary, this work offers insights into the significance of reset assumptions in the framework of DCIL and proposes SR-DCIL, a first step toward a versatile algorithm capable of learning control policies under a weaker reset assumption.</p>

                  <p>Large, distributed data streams are now ubiquitous.High-accuracy sketches with low memory overhead have become the de facto method for analyzing this data.For instance, if we wish to group data by some label and report the largest counts using fixed memory, we need to turn to mergeable heavy hitter sketches that can provide highly accurate approximate counts.Similarly, if we wish to keep track of the number of distinct items in a single set spread across several streams using fixed memory, we can turn to mergeable count distinct sketches that can provide highly accurate set cardinalities.   If we were to try to keep track of the cardinality of multiple sets and report only on the largest ones, maintaining individual count distinct sketches for each set can grow unwieldy, especially if the number of sets is not known in advance.We consider the natural combination of the heavy hitters problem with the count distinct problem, the heavy distinct hitters problem: given a stream of $(\ell, x)$ pairs, find all the labels $\ell$ that are paired with a large number of distinct items $x$ using only constant memory.   No previous work on heavy distinct hitters has managed to be of practical use in the large, distributed data stream setting.We propose a new algorithm, the Sampling Space-Saving Set Sketch, which combines sketching and sampling techniques and has all the desired properties for size, speed, accuracy, mergeability, and invertibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our algorithm to several existing solutions to the heavy distinct hitters problem, and provide experimental results across several data sets showing the superiority of the new sketch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowledge editing (KE) aims to efficiently and precisely modify the behavior of large language models (LLMs) to update specific knowledge without negatively influencing other knowledge.Current research primarily focuses on white-box LLMs editing, overlooking an important scenario: black-box LLMs editing, where LLMs are accessed through interfaces and only textual output is available.To address the limitations of existing evaluations that are not inapplicable to black-box LLM editing and lack comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective evaluation framework, incorporating the assessment of style retention for the first time.To tackle privacy leaks of editing data and style over-editing in current methods, we introduce a novel postEdit framework, resolving privacy concerns through downstream post-processing and maintaining textual style consistency via fine-grained editing to original responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments and analysis on two benchmarks demonstrate that postEdit outperforms all baselines and achieves strong generalization, especially with huge improvements on style retention (average $+20.82\%\uparrow$). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cybersecurity is a major challenge for large organizations.Traditional cybersecurity defense is reactive.Cybersecurity operations centers keep out adversaries and incident response teams clean up after break-ins.Recently a proactive stage has been introduced: Cyber Threat Hunting (TH) looks for potential compromises missed by other cyber defenses.TH is mandated for federal executive agencies and government contractors.As threat hunting is a new cybersecurity discipline, most TH teams operate without a defined process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The practices and challenges of TH have not yet been documented.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To address this gap, this paper describes the first interview study of threat hunt practitioners.We obtained access and interviewed 11 threat hunters associated with the U.S. government's Department of Homeland Security.Hour-long interviews were conducted.We analyzed the transcripts with process and thematic coding.We describe the diversity among their processes, show that their processes differ from the TH processes reported in the literature, and unify our subjects' descriptions into a single TH process.We enumerate common TH challenges and solutions according to the subjects.The two most common challenges were difficulty in assessing a Threat Hunter's expertise, and developing and maintaining automation.We conclude with recommendations for TH teams (improve planning, focus on automation, and apprentice new members) and highlight directions for future work (finding a TH process that balances flexibility and formalism, and identifying assessments for TH team performance).</p>

Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021.The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset.We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>With the exponential growth of the life science literature, biomedical text mining (BTM) has become an essential technology for accelerating the extraction of insights from publications.Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents.However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed.Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training.Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types.Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting.HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>
