                  <p>Animation techniques bring digital 3D worlds and characters to life.However, manual animation is tedious and automated techniques are often specialized to narrow shape classes.In our work, we propose a technique for automatic re-animation of arbitrary 3D shapes based on a motion prior extracted from a video diffusion model.Unlike existing 4D generation methods, we focus solely on the motion, and we leverage an explicit mesh-based representation compatible with existing computer-graphics pipelines.Furthermore, our utilization of diffusion features enhances accuracy of our motion fitting.We analyze efficacy of these features for animation fitting and we experimentally validate our approach for two different diffusion models and four animation models.Finally, we demonstrate that our time-efficient zero-shot method achieves a superior performance re-animating a diverse set of 3D shapes when compared to existing techniques in a user study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project website is located at https://lukas.uzolas.com/MotionDreamer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study delves into the realm of multi-modality (i.e., video and motion modalities) human behavior understanding by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).Diverging from recent LLMs designed for video-only or motion-only understanding, we argue that understanding human behavior necessitates joint modeling from both videos and motion sequences (e.g., SMPL sequences) to capture nuanced body part dynamics and semantics effectively.In light of this, we present MotionLLM, a straightforward yet effective framework for human motion understanding, captioning, and reasoning.Specifically, MotionLLM adopts a unified video-motion training strategy that leverages the complementary advantages of existing coarse video-text data and fine-grained motion-text data to glean rich spatial-temporal insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we collect a substantial dataset, MoVid, comprising diverse videos, motions, captions, and instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Additionally, we propose the MoVid-Bench, with carefully manual annotations, for better evaluation of human behavior understanding on video and motion.Extensive experiments show the superiority of MotionLLM in the caption, spatial-temporal comprehension, and reasoning ability.</p>

                  <p>Current autonomous driving technologies are being rolled out in geo-fenced areas with well-defined operation conditions such as time of operation, area, weather conditions and road conditions.In this way, challenging conditions as adverse weather, slippery road or densely-populated city centers can be excluded.In order to lift the geo-fenced restriction and allow a more dynamic availability of autonomous driving functions, it is necessary for the vehicle to autonomously perform an environment condition assessment in real time to identify when the system cannot operate safely and either stop operation or require the resting passenger to take control.In particular, adverse-weather challenges are a fundamental limitation as sensor performance degenerates quickly, prohibiting the use of sensors such as cameras to locate and monitor road signs, pedestrians or other vehicles.To address this issue, we train a deep learning model to identify outdoor weather and dangerous road conditions, enabling a quick reaction to new situations and environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve this by introducing an improved taxonomy and label hierarchy for a state-of-the-art adverse-weather dataset, relabelling it with a novel semi-automated labeling pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the novel proposed dataset and hierarchy, we train RECNet, a deep learning model for the classification of environment conditions from a single RGB frame. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>We outperform baseline models by relative 16% in F1- Score, while maintaining a real-time capable performance of 20 Hz.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving (AD) tasks turned a significant shift toward end-to-end fashion, particularly in the utilization of vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate robust logical reasoning and cognitive abilities to enable comprehensive end-to-end planning.However, these VLM-based approaches tend to integrate 2D vision tokenizers and a large language model (LLM) for ego-car planning, which lack 3D geometric priors as a cornerstone of reliable planning.Naturally, this observation raises a critical concern: Can a 2D-tokenized LLM accurately perceive the 3D environment?Our evaluation of current VLM-based methods across 3D object detection, vectorized map construction, and environmental caption suggests that the answer is, unfortunately, NO.In other words, 2D-tokenized LLM fails to provide reliable autonomous driving.In response, we introduce DETR-style 3D perceptrons as 3D tokenizers, which connect LLM with a one-layer linear projector.This simple yet elegant strategy, termed Atlas, harnesses the inherent priors of the 3D physical world, enabling it to simultaneously process high-resolution multi-view images and employ spatiotemporal modeling.Despite its simplicity, Atlas demonstrates superior performance in both 3D detection and ego planning tasks on nuScenes dataset, proving that 3D-tokenized LLM is the key to reliable autonomous driving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.895</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting.The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications.In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection.This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input.We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models.Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection.We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task.First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies.Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score.Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p>

                  <p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set.However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline.To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers.While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100.Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy.Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever.This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).}Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset.Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and link to datasets are available at https://github.com/yc-song/cmc <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to meet user information needs, but their effectiveness in dealing with user queries that contain various types of ambiguity remains unknown, ultimately risking user trust and satisfaction.To this end, we introduce CLAMBER, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs using a well-organized taxonomy.Building upon the taxonomy, we construct ~12K high-quality data to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of various off-the-shelf LLMs.Our findings indicate the limited practical utility of current LLMs in identifying and clarifying ambiguous user queries, even enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting.These techniques may result in overconfidence in LLMs and yield only marginal enhancements in identifying ambiguity.Furthermore, current LLMs fall short in generating high-quality clarifying questions due to a lack of conflict resolution and inaccurate utilization of inherent knowledge.In this paper, CLAMBER presents a guidance and promotes further research on proactive and trustworthy LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at https://github.com/zt991211/CLAMBER <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span></p>

                  <p>Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world, serving as a major source of information and learning resource for millions of users worldwide.While motivations for its usage vary, prior research suggests shallow information gathering -- looking up facts and information or answering questions -- dominates over more in-depth usage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the 22nd of November 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public and has quickly become a popular source of information, serving as an effective question-answering and knowledge gathering resource. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>Early indications have suggested that it may be drawing users away from traditional question answering services such as Stack Overflow, raising the question of how it may have impacted Wikipedia.In this paper, we explore Wikipedia user metrics across four areas: page views, unique visitor numbers, edit counts and editor numbers within twelve language instances of Wikipedia.We perform pairwise comparisons of these metrics before and after the release of ChatGPT and implement a panel regression model to observe and quantify longer-term trends.We find no evidence of a fall in engagement across any of the four metrics, instead observing that page views and visitor numbers increased in the period following ChatGPT's launch.However, we observe a lower increase in languages where ChatGPT was available than in languages where it was not, which may suggest ChatGPT's availability limited growth in those languages.Our results contribute to the understanding of how emerging generative AI tools are disrupting the Web ecosystem.</p>

In the end, we provide a real-world application example to demonstrate how we can achieve dynamic scene understanding by integrating a large language model into our PSG-4D system.</p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.This integrated approach yields remarkable results.In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources.Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how.Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links.Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective.The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices.This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT.This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links.We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics.SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), is an extension of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in logistics and transportation.Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers that deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from different locations.Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP such as ridesharing and non-compliance capture.Apart from original objectives like optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness for all parties.Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give up on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts.However, most existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a single side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and utility optimisation concurrently.To this end, we propose a novel framework, a Two-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the genetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to multi-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness.Subsequently, the impact of injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the correlation between any pair of the three objectives are explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video text spotting aims to simultaneously localize, recognize and track text instances in videos.To address the limited recognition capability of end-to-end methods, tracking the zero-shot results of state-of-the-art image text spotters directly can achieve impressive performance.However, owing to the domain gap between different datasets, these methods usually obtain limited tracking trajectories on extreme dataset.Fine-tuning transformer-based text spotters on specific datasets could yield performance enhancements, albeit at the expense of considerable training resources.In this paper, we propose a Language Collaboration and Glyph Perception Model, termed LOGO to enhance the performance of conventional text spotters through the integration of a synergy module.To achieve this goal, a language synergy classifier (LSC) is designed to explicitly discern text instances from background noise in the recognition stage.Specially, the language synergy classifier can output text content or background code based on the legibility of text regions, thus computing language scores.Subsequently, fusion scores are computed by taking the average of detection scores and language scores, and are utilized to re-score the detection results before tracking.By the re-scoring mechanism, the proposed LSC facilitates the detection of low-resolution text instances while filtering out text-like regions.Besides, the glyph supervision and visual position mixture module are proposed to enhance the recognition accuracy of noisy text regions, and acquire more discriminative tracking features, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image retrieval from contextual descriptions (IRCD) aims to identify an image within a set of minimally contrastive candidates based on linguistically complex text.Despite the success of VLMs, they still significantly lag behind human performance in IRCD.The main challenges lie in aligning key contextual cues in two modalities, where these subtle cues are concealed in tiny areas of multiple contrastive images and within the complex linguistics of textual descriptions.This motivates us to propose ContextBLIP, a simple yet effective method that relies on a doubly contextual alignment scheme for challenging IRCD.Specifically, 1) our model comprises a multi-scale adapter, a matching loss, and a text-guided masking loss.The adapter learns to capture fine-grained visual cues.The two losses enable iterative supervision for the adapter, gradually highlighting the focal patches of a single image to the key textual cues.We term such a way as intra-contextual alignment.2) Then, ContextBLIP further employs an inter-context encoder to learn dependencies among candidates, facilitating alignment between the text to multiple images.We term this step as inter-contextual alignment.Consequently, the nuanced cues concealed in each modality can be effectively aligned.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on two benchmarks show the superiority of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>We observe that ContextBLIP can yield comparable results with GPT-4V, despite involving about 7,500 times fewer parameters.</p>

                  <p>Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation.Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples.Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function.In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation.Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution.Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation.Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map.A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements in machine learning techniques have led to significant achievements in various real-world robotic tasks.These tasks heavily rely on fast and energy-efficient inference of deep neural network (DNN) models when deployed on robots.To enhance inference performance, distributed inference has emerged as a promising approach, parallelizing inference across multiple powerful GPU devices in modern data centers using techniques such as data parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.However, when deployed on real-world robots, existing parallel methods fail to provide low inference latency and meet the energy requirements due to the limited bandwidth of robotic IoT. We present Hybrid-Parallel, a high-performance distributed inference system optimized for robotic IoT. Hybrid-Parallel employs a fine-grained approach to parallelize inference at the granularity of local operators within DNN layers (i.e., operators that can be computed independently with the partial input, such as the convolution kernel in the convolution layer).By doing so, Hybrid-Parallel enables different operators of different layers to be computed and transmitted concurrently, and overlap the computation and transmission phases within the same inference task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation demonstrate that Hybrid-Parallel reduces inference time by 14.9% ~41.1% and energy consumption per inference by up to 35.3% compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life.While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion.This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection.The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles.The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</p>

                  <p>A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering with given metric constraints.Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e., metric autocorrelation.The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure.In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, MC-GTA (Model-based Clustering via Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations).Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram).We show that MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from the same distribution.Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms strong baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and stabler optimization (>10x speedup). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span></p>

                  <p>Coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) are gaining traction thanks to their performance and power efficiency.Utilizing CGRAs to accelerate the execution of tight loops holds great potential for achieving significant overall performance gains, as a substantial portion of program execution time is dedicated to tight loops.But loop parallelization using CGRAs is challenging because of loop-carried data dependencies.Traditionally, loop-carried dependencies are handled by spilling dependent values out of the reconfigurable array to a memory medium and then feeding them back to the grid.Spilling the values and feeding them back into the grid imposes additional latencies and logic that impede performance and limit parallelism.   In this paper, we present the Dependency Resolved CGRA (DR-CGRA) architecture that is designed to accelerate the execution of tight loops.DR-CGRA, which is based on a massively-multithreaded CGRA, runs each iteration as a separate CGRA thread and maps loop-carried data dependencies to inter-thread communication inside the grid.This design ensures the passage of data-dependent values across loop iterations without spilling them out of the grid.   The proposed DR-CGRA architecture was evaluated on various SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrated significant performance improvements, with an average speedup ranging from 2.1 to 4.5 and an overall average of 3.1 when compared to state-of-the-art CGRA architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding human behavior fundamentally relies on accurate 3D human pose estimation.Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising advancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight architectures.In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is effective.Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where edges in the input graph are missing.To this end, we propose a novel positional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular components from the eigenbasis.Our method involves applying multiple perturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular component from the eigenbasis.PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors.Employing this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model.Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our experimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to $12\%$ on the Human3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one edge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in scenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery.Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data.However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection.To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations.We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements.This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection.Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training.Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance.Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Business Document Information Extraction (BDIE) is the problem of transforming a blob of unstructured information (raw text, scanned documents, etc.) into a structured format that downstream systems can parse and use.It has two main tasks: Key-Information Extraction (KIE) and Line Items Recognition (LIR).In this paper, we argue that BDIE is best modeled as a Tool Use problem, where the tools are these downstream systems.We then present Retrieval Augmented Structured Generation (RASG), a novel general framework for BDIE that achieves state of the art (SOTA) results on both KIE and LIR tasks on BDIE benchmarks.   The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We show, with ablation benchmarks, that Large Language Models (LLMs) with RASG are already competitive with or surpasses current SOTA Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) without RASG on BDIE benchmarks.(2) We propose a new metric class for Line Items Recognition, General Line Items Recognition Metric (GLIRM), that is more aligned with practical BDIE use cases compared to existing metrics, such as ANLS*, DocILE, and GriTS.(3) We provide a heuristic algorithm for backcalculating bounding boxes of predicted line items and tables without the need for vision encoders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we claim that, while LMMs might sometimes offer marginal performance benefits, LLMs + RASG is oftentimes superior given real-world applications and constraints of BDIE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>
