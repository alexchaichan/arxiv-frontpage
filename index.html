                  <p>Recent works in hand-object reconstruction mainly focus on the single-view and dense multi-view settings.On the one hand, single-view methods can leverage learned shape priors to generalise to unseen objects but are prone to inaccuracies due to occlusions.On the other hand, dense multi-view methods are very accurate but cannot easily adapt to unseen objects without further data collection.In contrast, sparse multi-view methods can take advantage of the additional views to tackle occlusion, while keeping the computational cost low compared to dense multi-view methods.In this paper, we consider the problem of hand-object reconstruction with unseen objects in the sparse multi-view setting.Given multiple RGB images of the hand and object captured at the same time, our model SVHO combines the predictions from each view into a unified reconstruction without optimisation across views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our model on a synthetic hand-object dataset and evaluate directly on a real world recorded hand-object dataset with unseen objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>We show that while reconstruction of unseen hands and objects from RGB is challenging, additional views can help improve the reconstruction quality.</p>

                  <p>The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks.However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved.The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective.In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks.Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points.We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks.We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2.Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in human-populated environments.State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment.In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s.We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene.This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation.We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on explicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product images, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection across diverse domains.To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction.ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains.We also explore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit AVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE dataset.Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs.The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/HenryPengZou/ImplicitAVE <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face recognition applications have grown in parallel with the size of datasets, complexity of deep learning models and computational power.However, while deep learning models evolve to become more capable and computational power keeps increasing, the datasets available are being retracted and removed from public access.Privacy and ethical concerns are relevant topics within these domains.Through generative artificial intelligence, researchers have put efforts into the development of completely synthetic datasets that can be used to train face recognition systems.Nonetheless, the recent advances have not been sufficient to achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models trained on real data.To study the drift between the performance of models trained on real and synthetic datasets, we leverage a massive attribute classifier (MAC) to create annotations for four datasets: two real and two synthetic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>From these annotations, we conduct studies on the distribution of each attribute within all four datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Additionally, we further inspect the differences between real and synthetic datasets on the attribute set.When comparing through the Kullback-Leibler divergence we have found differences between real and synthetic samples.Interestingly enough, we have verified that while real samples suffice to explain the synthetic distribution, the opposite could not be further from being true.</p>

                  <p>Graph augmentation has received great attention in recent years for graph contrastive learning (GCL) to learn well-generalized node/graph representations.However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation, which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level graph information, i.e., the graph community.Moreover, current knowledge-based graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing the model to lack robustness against various types of noise.To address these limitations, this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation.Based on our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph community structure during learnable graph augmentation.By maximizing the spectral changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Code is released on Github (https://github.com/ShiyinTan/CI-GCL.git).</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML).The interest is driven by the numerous situations in real-life applications where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously.A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which illustrates the inherent trade-offs between objectives.Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature that could serve as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners who want to use MOO.Hence, our goal in this paper is to produce such a resource.We critically review previous studies, particularly those involving MOO in deep learning (using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a guiding example), and identify misconceptions that highlight the need for a better grasp of MOO principles in ML.Using MOO of PINNs as a case study, we demonstrate the interplay between the data loss and the physics loss terms.We highlight the most common pitfalls one should avoid while using MOO techniques in ML.We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more complex techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA).Additionally, we compare the results obtained from the WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence can result in inaccurate outcomes and, consequently, a non-optimal solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our goal is to offer a clear and practical guide for ML practitioners to effectively apply MOO, particularly in the context of DL.</p>

First, we introduce a general technique involving a hierarchical $\epsilon$-nets to prove least singular value bounds.Our second tool is a new statement about least singular values to reason about higher-order lifts of smoothed matrices, and the action of linear operators on them.   Apart from getting simpler proofs of existing smoothed analysis results, we use these tools to now handle more general families of random matrices.This allows us to produce smoothed analysis guarantees in several previously open settings.These include new smoothed analysis guarantees for power sum decompositions, subspace clustering and certifying robust entanglement of subspaces, where prior work could only establish least singular value bounds for fully random instances or only show non-robust genericity guarantees.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution.Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem.When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches.To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation.This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex.Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup.Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states.Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video.However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden.In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram).However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important.To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews.In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player.NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis.Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis.EALD will be available on the open-source platform.</p>

                  <p>Debiased collaborative filtering aims to learn an unbiased prediction model by removing different biases in observational datasets.To solve this problem, one of the simple and effective methods is based on the propensity score, which adjusts the observational sample distribution to the target one by reweighting observed instances.Ideally, propensity scores should be learned with causal balancing constraints.However, existing methods usually ignore such constraints or implement them with unreasonable approximations, which may affect the accuracy of the learned propensity scores.To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first analyze the gaps between the causal balancing requirements and existing methods such as learning the propensity with cross-entropy loss or manually selecting functions to balance.Inspired by these gaps, we propose to approximate the balancing functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that, based on the universal property and representer theorem of kernel functions, the causal balancing constraints can be better satisfied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, we propose an algorithm that adaptively balances the kernel function and theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of our methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and to promote this research direction, we have released our project at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/ICLR24-Kernel-Balancing.</p>

To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs.ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing.We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types.Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats.

                  <p>In this paper, the problem of spectral-efficient communication and computation resource allocation for distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is investigated.In the considered model, multiple RISs are deployed to serve multiple users, while PSC adopts compute-then-transmit protocol to reduce the transmission data size.To support high-rate transmission, the semantic compression ratio, transmit power allocation, and distributed RISs deployment must be jointly considered.This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum semantic-aware transmission rate of the system under total transmit power, phase shift, RIS-user association, and semantic compression ratio constraints.To solve this problem, a many-to-many matching scheme is proposed to solve the RIS-user association subproblem, the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed following greedy policy, while the phase shift of RIS can be optimized using the tensor based beamforming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces YOLOv8-TO, a novel approach for reverse engineering of topology-optimized structures into interpretable geometric parameters using the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model.Density-based topology optimization methods require post-processing to convert the optimal density distribution into a parametric representation for design exploration and integration with CAD tools.Traditional methods such as skeletonization struggle with complex geometries and require manual intervention.YOLOv8-TO addresses these challenges by training a custom YOLOv8 model to automatically detect and reconstruct structural components from binary density distributions.The model is trained on a diverse dataset of both optimized and random structures generated using the Moving Morphable Components method.A custom reconstruction loss function based on the dice coefficient of the predicted geometry is used to train the new regression head of the model via self-supervised learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method is evaluated on test sets generated from different topology optimization methods, including out-of-distribution samples, and compared against a skeletonization approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Results show that YOLOv8-TO significantly outperforms skeletonization in reconstructing visually and structurally similar designs.The method showcases an average improvement of 13.84% in the Dice coefficient, with peak enhancements reaching 20.78%.The method demonstrates good generalization to complex geometries and fast inference times, making it suitable for integration into design workflows using regular workstations.Limitations include the sensitivity to non-max suppression thresholds.YOLOv8-TO represents a significant advancement in topology optimization post-processing, enabling efficient and accurate reverse engineering of optimized structures for design exploration and manufacturing.</p>

                  <p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown excellent performance on various downstream tasks after fine-tuning.Nevertheless, the escalating concerns surrounding user privacy have posed significant challenges to centralized training reliant on extensive data collection.Federated learning(FL), which only requires training on the clients and aggregates weights on the server without sharing data, has emerged as a solution.However, the substantial parameter size of PLMs places a significant burden on the computational resources of client devices, while also leading to costly communication expenses.Introducing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) into FL can effectively address this problem.However, we observe that the non-IID data in federated learning leads to a gap in performance between the PEFT method and full parameter fine-tuning(FT).To overcome this, we propose FeDeRA, an improvement over the LoRA method in FL. FeDeRA uses the same adapter module as LoRA.However, the difference lies in FeDeRA's initialization of the adapter module by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained matrix and selecting its principal components.We conducted extensive experiments, using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3, on three tasks and six datasets, comparing the methods including FT and the other three different PEFT methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FeDeRA outperforms all other PEFT methods and is comparable to or even surpasses the performance of FT methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We also deployed federated learning on Jetson AGX Orin and compared the time required by different methods to achieve the target accuracy on specific tasks.Compared to FT, FeDeRA reduces the training time by 95.9%, 97.9%, 96.9%, and 97.3%, 96.5%, and 96.5% respectively on three tasks using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The overall experiments indicate that FeDeRA achieves good performance while also maintaining efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bridging the significant gap between large language model's English and non-English performance presents a great challenge.While some previous studies attempt to mitigate this gap with translated training data, the recently proposed question alignment approach leverages the model's English expertise to improve multilingual performance with minimum usage of expensive, error-prone translation.In this paper, we explore how broadly this method can be applied by examining its effects in reasoning with executable code and reasoning with common sense.We also explore how to apply this approach efficiently to extremely large language models using proxy-tuning.Experiment results on multilingual reasoning benchmarks mGSM, mSVAMP and xCSQA demonstrate that the question alignment approach can be used to boost multilingual performance across diverse reasoning scenarios, model families, and sizes.For instance, when applied to the LLaMA2 models, our method brings an average accuracy improvements of 12.2% on mGSM even with the 70B model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To understand the mechanism of its success, we analyze representation space, chain-of-thought and translation data scales, which reveals how question translation training strengthens language alignment within LLMs and shapes their working patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality.However, this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the relationship between primitives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation.On one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives while preserving desired signals.On the other hand, to compensate for the quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights.We demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results.For example, SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.Codes are publicly available at https://runyiyang.github.io/projects/SUNDAE/.</p>
