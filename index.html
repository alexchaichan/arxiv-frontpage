                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens.However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios.This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks.We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window.However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically.This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences.Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence.Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved.Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs.We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard modality to understand human brain structure and function in vivo (antemortem).Decades of research in human neuroimaging has led to the widespread development of methods and tools to provide automated volume-based segmentations and surface-based parcellations which help localize brain functions to specialized anatomical regions.Recently ex vivo (postmortem) imaging of the brain has opened-up avenues to study brain structure at sub-millimeter ultra high-resolution revealing details not possible to observe with in vivo MRI.Unfortunately, there has been limited methodological development in ex vivo MRI primarily due to lack of datasets and limited centers with such imaging resources.Therefore, in this work, we present one-of-its-kind dataset of 82 ex vivo T2w whole brain hemispheres MRI at 0.3 mm isotropic resolution spanning Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.We adapted and developed a fast and easy-to-use automated surface-based pipeline to parcellate, for the first time, ultra high-resolution ex vivo brain tissue at the native subject space resolution using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) brain atlas.This allows us to perform vertex-wise analysis in the template space and thereby link morphometry measures with pathology measurements derived from histology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source our dataset docker container, Jupyter notebooks for ready-to-use out-of-the-box set of tools and command line options to advance ex vivo MRI clinical brain imaging research on the project webpage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system.This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR).When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively.However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data.Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs.Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed.The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</p>

                  <p>Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with broad applications.However, existing works often simplify this task within the context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting surface classes to smooth ones.Although promising, such simplifications hinder generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use.In this paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization (ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image restoration and shadow removal in a broader context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the lack of appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution dataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of its kind. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend, a novel strong baseline that maximizes Image-Frequency joint entropy to selectively restore local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow localization priors.Experiments show that IFBlend achieves SOTA scores on Ambient6K and exhibits competitive performance on conventional shadow removal benchmarks compared to shadow-specific models with mask priors.The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend.</p>

                  <p>Faithful human performance capture and free-view rendering from sparse RGB observations is a long-standing problem in Vision and Graphics.The main challenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the setting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity.As a result, radiance fields, which have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and geometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\"ively supervising them on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view inputs.To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and high-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or even a single view of the human.Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance field weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve as a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human.This prior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively addressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture.Due to the articulated structure of the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a prior is non-trivial.Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in a pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes feature learning more effective.Consequently, one can fine-tune our field parameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions as well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluating our method under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which contains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse camera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent state-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gestures play a key role in human communication.Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance.Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing.Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released, which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.94</span></span>We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks.We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at our website.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question.This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers.However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question.As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization.In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation.RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information.To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking.Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address unsupervised domain adaptation under noisy environments, which is more challenging and practical than traditional domain adaptation.In this scenario, the model is prone to overfitting noisy labels, resulting in a more pronounced domain shift and a notable decline in the overall model performance.Previous methods employed prototype methods for domain adaptation on robust feature spaces.However, these approaches struggle to effectively classify classes with similar features under noisy environments.To address this issue, we propose a new method to detect and correct confusing class pair.We first divide classes into easy and hard classes based on the small loss criterion.We then leverage the top-2 predictions for each sample after aligning the source and target domain to find the confusing pair in the hard classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply label correction to the noisy samples within the confusing pair. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the proposed label correction method, we can train our model with more accurate labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its favorable performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Hehxcf/CPC/.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models are transformative in sequential recommender systems, leveraging powerful representation learning capabilities.While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed.Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation.   IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT.More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks.Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT.This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training.   Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that "parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We release our codes and other materials at https://github.com/jjGenAILab/IISAN.</p>

                  <p>Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence.This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution.However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network.To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution.Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution.In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares.The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM).For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm.To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs.Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach.Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25% reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce an innovative task focused on human communication, aiming to generate 3D holistic human motions for both speakers and listeners.Central to our approach is the incorporation of factorization to decouple audio features and the combination of textual semantic information, thereby facilitating the creation of more realistic and coordinated movements.We separately train VQ-VAEs with respect to the holistic motions of both speaker and listener.We consider the real-time mutual influence between the speaker and the listener and propose a novel chain-like transformer-based auto-regressive model specifically designed to characterize real-world communication scenarios effectively which can generate the motions of both the speaker and the listener simultaneously.These designs ensure that the results we generate are both coordinated and diverse.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Furthermore, we introduce the HoCo holistic communication dataset, which is a valuable resource for future research.Our HoCo dataset and code will be released for research purposes upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a promising task to train high-performance small models to enhance actual deployment without relying on the original training data.Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data.However, a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data, which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions.The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks.To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts.By designing a customized causal graph, we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task.Subsequently, we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder.KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI, which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings, \textit{e.g.}, improving the baseline by up to 15.54\% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenges related to data sparsity, cold-start problems, and diversity in recommendation systems is both crucial and demanding.Many current solutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both item-based and user-item collaborative signals.A common trend in these approaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating model complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task.It is essential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse, rather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as Click-through Rate, Recall, etc.In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task learning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions.We apply item-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and negative pairs based on item metadata.Our approach allows the model to better understand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by utilizing semantic information from text.It leads to more accurate, relevant, and diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start users who have few interactions with items.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on two widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that jointly training user-item interactions and item-based signals using synopsis text is highly effective.Furthermore, our results provide evidence that item-based contrastive learning enhances the quality of entity embeddings, as indicated by metrics such as uniformity and alignment.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm.Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position.To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances.To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements.To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency.However, there are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG) answers are required.The misalignment between the task and the evaluation method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in two languages: Chinese and English.We identify a significant issue: LLMs exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at specific positions, i.e., the first position.We further quantify the gap between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings.Our results reveal a relatively low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the greater the accuracy.We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms of expected calibration error.Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding space.Our code and models can be accessed at https://github.com/Meetyou-AI-Lab/Can-MC-Evaluate-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Expressive human pose and shape estimation (a.k.a. 3D whole-body mesh recovery) involves the human body, hand, and expression estimation.Most existing methods have tackled this task in a two-stage manner, first detecting the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and inferring the different human body parts individually.Despite the impressive results achieved, these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information via cropping, 2) introducing distractions, and 3) lacking inter-association among different persons and body parts, inevitably causing performance degradation, especially for crowded scenes.To address these issues, we introduce a novel all-in-one-stage framework, AiOS, for multiple expressive human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step.Specifically, our method is built upon DETR, which treats multi-person whole-body mesh recovery task as a progressive set prediction problem with various sequential detection.We devise the decoder tokens and extend them to our task.Specifically, we first employ a human token to probe a human location in the image and encode global features for each instance, which provides a coarse location for the later transformer block.Then, we introduce a joint-related token to probe the human joint in the image and encoder a fine-grained local feature, which collaborates with the global feature to regress the whole-body mesh.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This straightforward but effective model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a 9% reduction in NMVE on AGORA, a 30% reduction in PVE on EHF, a 10% reduction in PVE on ARCTIC, and a 3% reduction in PVE on EgoBody. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gestures play a key role in human communication.Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance.Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing.Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released, which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at our website.</p>

                Code Revert Prediction with Graph Neural Networks: A Case Study at J.P. Morgan Chase

                  <p>Code revert prediction, a specialized form of software defect detection, aims to forecast or predict the likelihood of code changes being reverted or rolled back in software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is very important in practice because by identifying code changes that are more prone to being reverted, developers and project managers can proactively take measures to prevent issues, improve code quality, and optimize development processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>However, compared to code defect detection, code revert prediction has been rarely studied in previous research.Additionally, many previous methods for code defect detection relied on independent features but ignored relationships between code scripts.Moreover, new challenges are introduced due to constraints in an industry setting such as company regulation, limited features and large-scale codebase.To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a systematic empirical study for code revert prediction that integrates the code import graph with code features.Different strategies to address anomalies and data imbalance have been implemented including graph neural networks with imbalance classification and anomaly detection.We conduct the experiments on real-world code commit data within J.P. Morgan Chase which is extremely imbalanced in order to make a comprehensive comparison of these different approaches for the code revert prediction problem.</p>
