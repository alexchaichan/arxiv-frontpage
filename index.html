                  <p>For a complete comprehension of multi-person scenes, it is essential to go beyond basic tasks like detection and tracking.Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial.Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks.To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data.The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable and data efficient representations of motion in human crowded scenes.Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints' trajectory in the frequency domain.After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks.Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>With recent advancements in visual synthesis, there is a growing risk of encountering images with detrimental effects, such as hate, discrimination, or privacy violations.The research on transforming harmful images into responsible ones remains unexplored.In this paper, we formulate a new task, responsible visual editing, which entails modifying specific concepts within an image to render it more responsible while minimizing changes.However, the concept that needs to be edited is often abstract, making it challenging to locate what needs to be modified and plan how to modify it.To tackle these challenges, we propose a Cognitive Editor (CoEditor) that harnesses the large multimodal model through a two-stage cognitive process: (1) a perceptual cognitive process to focus on what needs to be modified and (2) a behavioral cognitive process to strategize how to modify.To mitigate the negative implications of harmful images on research, we create a transparent and public dataset, AltBear, which expresses harmful information using teddy bears instead of humans.Experiments demonstrate that CoEditor can effectively comprehend abstract concepts within complex scenes and significantly surpass the performance of baseline models for responsible visual editing.We find that the AltBear dataset corresponds well to the harmful content found in real images, offering a consistent experimental evaluation, thereby providing a safer benchmark for future research.Moreover, CoEditor also shows great results in general editing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/kodenii/Responsible-Visual-Editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists.Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views.Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold.First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back).Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered.This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator.In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts.We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens.In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities.Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens).Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs.We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing.These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding.To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks.Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</p>

                  <p>Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years.Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training.These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations.Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art.Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training.In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn.None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time.This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images.It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image.To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery.Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations.Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset will be available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIS25k . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.943</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks.In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks.However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ).Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training.Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively.However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes.This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes.Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks.With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes.The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture.We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens.However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios.This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks.We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window.However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically.This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences.Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence.Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved.Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs.We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs.</p>

                  <p>We present a new self-supervised approach, SelfPose3d, for estimating 3d poses of multiple persons from multiple camera views.Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods, our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator.We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation.We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points, serving as 3d person root positions, and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views.We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation, map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints, and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner.Afterwards, we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels, we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Our experiments and analysis on three public benchmark datasets, including Panoptic, Shelf, and Campus, show the effectiveness of our approach, which is comparable to fully-supervised methods.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SelfPose3D}</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question.This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers.However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question.As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization.In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation.RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information.To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking.Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA.However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved.Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content.Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions.Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic.In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering.To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance.Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English.Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>gRPC is at the heart of modern distributed system architectures.Based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, it provides highly performant, standardized, and polyglot communication across loosely coupled microservices and is increasingly preferred over REST- or GraphQL-based service APIs in practice.Despite its widespread adoption, gRPC lacks any advanced privacy techniques beyond transport encryption and basic token-based authentication.Such advanced techniques are, however, increasingly important for fulfilling regulatory requirements.For instance, anonymizing or otherwise minimizing (personal) data before responding to requests, or pre-processing data based on the purpose of the access may be crucial in certain usecases.In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach for integrating such advanced privacy techniques into the gRPC framework in a practically viable way.Specifically, we present a general approach along with a working prototype that implements privacy techniques, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, in a configurable, extensible, and gRPC-native way utilizing a gRPC interceptor.We also showcase how to integrate this contribution into a realistic example of a food delivery use case.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Alongside these implementations, a preliminary performance evaluation shows practical applicability with reasonable overheads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Altogether, we present a viable solution for integrating advanced privacy techniques into real-world gRPC-based microservice architectures, thereby facilitating regulatory compliance ``by design''.</p>

                  <p>Movie trailers are an essential tool for promoting films and attracting audiences.However, the process of creating trailers can be time-consuming and expensive.To streamline this process, we propose an automatic trailer generation framework that generates plausible trailers from a full movie by automating shot selection and composition.Our approach draws inspiration from machine translation techniques and models the movies and trailers as sequences of shots, thus formulating the trailer generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence task.We introduce Trailer Generation Transformer (TGT), a deep-learning framework utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture.TGT movie encoder is tasked with contextualizing each movie shot representation via self-attention, while the autoregressive trailer decoder predicts the feature representation of the next trailer shot, accounting for the relevance of shots' temporal order in trailers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our TGT significantly outperforms previous methods on a comprehensive suite of metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid development of 3D acquisition technology has made it possible to obtain point clouds of real-world terrains.However, due to limitations in sensor acquisition technology or specific requirements, point clouds often contain defects such as holes with missing data.Inpainting algorithms are widely used to patch these holes.However, existing traditional inpainting algorithms rely on precise hole boundaries, which limits their ability to handle cases where the boundaries are not well-defined.On the other hand, learning-based completion methods often prioritize reconstructing the entire point cloud instead of solely focusing on hole filling.Based on the fact that real-world terrain exhibits both global smoothness and rich local detail, we propose a novel representation for terrain point clouds.This representation can help to repair the holes without clear boundaries.Specifically, it decomposes terrains into low-frequency and high-frequency components, which are represented by B-spline surfaces and relative height maps respectively.In this way, the terrain point cloud inpainting problem is transformed into a B-spline surface fitting and 2D image inpainting problem.By solving the two problems, the highly complex and irregular holes on the terrain point clouds can be well-filled, which not only satisfies the global terrain undulation but also exhibits rich geometric details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span></p>

                  <p>NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has demonstrated tremendous potential in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but its performance is sensitive to input image quality, which struggles to achieve high-fidelity rendering when provided with low-quality sparse input viewpoints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous methods for NeRF restoration are tailored for specific degradation type, ignoring the generality of restoration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To overcome this limitation, we propose a generic radiance fields restoration pipeline, named RaFE, which applies to various types of degradations, such as low resolution, blurriness, noise, compression artifacts, or their combinations.Our approach leverages the success of off-the-shelf 2D restoration methods to recover the multi-view images individually.Instead of reconstructing a blurred NeRF by averaging inconsistencies, we introduce a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for NeRF generation to better accommodate the geometric and appearance inconsistencies present in the multi-view images.Specifically, we adopt a two-level tri-plane architecture, where the coarse level remains fixed to represent the low-quality NeRF, and a fine-level residual tri-plane to be added to the coarse level is modeled as a distribution with GAN to capture potential variations in restoration.We validate RaFE on both synthetic and real cases for various restoration tasks, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, surpassing other 3D restoration methods specific to single task.Please see our project website https://zkaiwu.github.io/RaFE-Project/.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments underscore the potential of textual information in enhancing learning models for a deeper understanding of medical visual semantics.However, language-guided medical image segmentation still faces a challenging issue.Previous works employ implicit and ambiguous architectures to embed textual information.This leads to segmentation results that are inconsistent with the semantics represented by the language, sometimes even diverging significantly.To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal conditioned Reconstruction for Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation (RecLMIS) to explicitly capture cross-modal interactions, which assumes that well-aligned medical visual features and medical notes can effectively reconstruct each other.We introduce conditioned interaction to adaptively predict patches and words of interest.Subsequently, they are utilized as conditioning factors for mutual reconstruction to align with regions described in the medical notes.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RecLMIS, surpassing LViT by 3.74% mIoU on the publicly available MosMedData+ dataset and achieving an average increase of 1.89% mIoU for cross-domain tests on our QATA-CoV19 dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simultaneously, we achieve a relative reduction of 20.2% in parameter count and a 55.5% decrease in computational load. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The code will be available at https://github.com/ShashankHuang/RecLMIS.</p>

                  <p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which aims to generate molecules that can bind tightly to the target protein, is an essential problem in drug discovery, and previous approaches have achieved initial success.However, most existing methods still suffer from invalid local structure or unrealistic conformation issues, which are mainly due to the poor leaning of bond angles or torsional angles.To alleviate these problems, we propose AUTODIFF, a diffusion-based fragment-wise autoregressive generation model.Specifically, we design a novel molecule assembly strategy named conformal motif that preserves the conformation of local structures of molecules first, then we encode the interaction of the protein-ligand complex with an SE(3)-equivariant convolutional network and generate molecules motif-by-motif with diffusion modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we also improve the evaluation framework of SBDD by constraining the molecular weights of the generated molecules in the same range, together with some new metrics, which make the evaluation more fair and practical. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing models in generating realistic molecules with valid structures and conformations while maintaining high binding affinity.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models are transformative in sequential recommender systems, leveraging powerful representation learning capabilities.While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed.Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation.   IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT.More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks.Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT.This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training.   Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that "parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We release our codes and other materials at https://github.com/jjGenAILab/IISAN.</p>

                  <p>Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence.This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution.However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network.To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution.Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution.In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares.The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM).For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm.To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs.Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach.Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25% reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm.Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position.To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances.To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements.To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diverse actions give rise to rich audio-visual signals in long videos.Recent works showcase that the two modalities of audio and video exhibit different temporal extents of events and distinct labels.We address the interplay between the two modalities in long videos by explicitly modelling the temporal extents of audio and visual events.We propose the Time Interval Machine (TIM) where a modality-specific time interval poses as a query to a transformer encoder that ingests a long video input.The encoder then attends to the specified interval, as well as the surrounding context in both modalities, in order to recognise the ongoing action.   We test TIM on three long audio-visual video datasets: EPIC-KITCHENS, Perception Test, and AVE, reporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) for recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On EPIC-KITCHENS, we beat previous SOTA that utilises LLMs and significantly larger pre-training by 2.9% top-1 action recognition accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Additionally, we show that TIM can be adapted for action detection, using dense multi-scale interval queries, outperforming SOTA on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 for most metrics, and showing strong performance on the Perception Test.Our ablations show the critical role of integrating the two modalities and modelling their time intervals in achieving this performance.Code and models at: https://github.com/JacobChalk/TIM</p>

                  <p>In the financial industry, identifying the location of parties involved in payments is a major challenge in the context of various regulatory requirements.For this purpose address parsing entails extracting fields such as street, postal code, or country from free text message attributes.While payment processing platforms are updating their standards with more structured formats such as SWIFT with ISO 20022, address parsing remains essential for a considerable volume of messages.With the emergence of Transformers and Generative Large Language Models (LLM), we explore the performance of state-of-the-art solutions given the constraint of processing a vast amount of daily data.This paper also aims to show the need for training robust models capable of dealing with real-world noisy transactional data.Our results suggest that a well fine-tuned Transformer model using early-stopping significantly outperforms other approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, generative LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance and warrant further investigations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the advancement of diffusion models (DMs) and the substantially increased computational requirements, quantization emerges as a practical solution to obtain compact and efficient low-bit DMs.However, the highly discrete representation leads to severe accuracy degradation, hindering the quantization of diffusion models to ultra-low bit-widths.In this paper, we propose BinaryDM, a novel accurate quantization-aware training approach to push the weights of diffusion models towards the limit of 1-bit.Firstly, we present a Learnable Multi-basis Binarizer (LMB) to recover the representations generated by the binarized DM, which improves the information in details of representations crucial to the DM.Secondly, a Low-rank Representation Mimicking (LRM) is applied to enhance the binarization-aware optimization of the DM, alleviating the optimization direction ambiguity caused by fine-grained alignment.Moreover, a progressive initialization strategy is applied to training DMs to avoid convergence difficulties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gains compared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>As the first binarization method for diffusion models, BinaryDM achieves impressive 16.0 times FLOPs and 27.1 times storage savings with 1-bit weight and 4-bit activation, showcasing its substantial advantages and potential for deploying DMs on resource-limited scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Automated program verifiers are typically implemented using an intermediate verification language (IVL), such as Boogie or Why3.A verifier front-end translates the input program and specification into an IVL program, while the back-end generates proof obligations for the IVL program and employs an SMT solver to discharge them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Soundness of such verifiers therefore requires that the front-end translation faithfully captures the semantics of the input program and specification in the IVL program, and that the back-end reports success only if the IVL program is actually correct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>For a verification tool to be trustworthy, these soundness conditions must be satisfied by its actual implementation, not just the program logic it uses.   In this paper, we present a novel validation methodology that, given a formal semantics for the input language and IVL, provides formal soundness guarantees for front-end implementations.For each run of the verifier, we automatically generate a proof in Isabelle showing that the correctness of the produced IVL program implies the correctness of the input program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This proof can be checked independently from the verifier in Isabelle and can be combined with existing work on validating back-ends to obtain an end-to-end soundness result. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Our methodology based on forward simulation employs several modularisation strategies to handle the large semantic gap between the input language and the IVL, as well as the intricacies of practical, optimised translations.We present our methodology for the widely-used Viper and Boogie languages.Our evaluation shows that it is effective in validating the translations performed by the existing Viper implementation.</p>
