                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>Cancelable Biometric is a challenging research field in which security of an original biometric image is ensured by transforming the original biometric into another irreversible domain.Several approaches have been suggested in literature for generating cancelable biometric templates.In this paper, two novel and simple cancelable biometric template generation methods based on Random Walk (CBRW) have been proposed.By employing random walk and other steps given in the proposed two algorithms viz.CBRW-BitXOR and CBRW-BitCMP, the original biometric is transformed into a cancellable template.The performance of the proposed methods is compared with other state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments have been performed on eight publicly available gray and color datasets i.e. CP (ear) (gray and color), UTIRIS (iris) (gray and color), ORL (face) (gray), IIT Delhi (iris) (gray and color), and AR (face) (color). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Performance of the generated templates is measured in terms of Correlation Coefficient (Cr), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI).By experimental results, it has been proved that proposed methods are superior than other state-of-the-art methods in qualitative as well as quantitative analysis.Furthermore, CBRW performs better on both gray as well as color images.</p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenges of rare diseases is difficult, especially with the limited number of reference images and a small patient population.This is more evident in rare skin diseases, where we encounter long-tailed data distributions that make it difficult to develop unbiased and broadly effective models.The diverse ways in which image datasets are gathered and their distinct purposes also add to these challenges.Our study conducts a detailed examination of the benefits and drawbacks of episodic and conventional training methodologies, adopting a few-shot learning approach alongside transfer learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our models using the ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>With minimal labeled examples, our models showed substantial information gains and better performance compared to previously trained models.Our research emphasizes the improved ability to represent features in DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2 models, achieved by using pre-trained models on ImageNet to increase similarities within classes.Moreover, our experiments, ranging from 2-way to 5-way classifications with up to 10 examples, showed a growing success rate for traditional transfer learning methods as the number of examples increased.The addition of data augmentation techniques significantly improved our transfer learning based model performance, leading to higher performances than existing methods, especially in the SD-198 and ISIC2018 datasets.All source code related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.</p>

                  <p>Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data.Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing.To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment.To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research.Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback.Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning.Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce a new area of study in the field of educational Natural Language Processing: Automated Long Answer Grading (ALAG).Distinguishing itself from Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and Automated Essay Grading (AEG), ALAG presents unique challenges due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of fact-based long answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study ALAG, we introduce RiceChem, a dataset derived from a college chemistry course, featuring real student responses to long-answer questions with an average word count notably higher than typical ASAG datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>We propose a novel approach to ALAG by formulating it as a rubric entailment problem, employing natural language inference models to verify whether each criterion, represented by a rubric item, is addressed in the student's response.This formulation enables the effective use of MNLI for transfer learning, significantly improving the performance of models on the RiceChem dataset.We demonstrate the importance of rubric-based formulation in ALAG, showcasing its superiority over traditional score-based approaches in capturing the nuances of student responses.We also investigate the performance of models in cold start scenarios, providing valuable insights into the practical deployment considerations in educational settings.Lastly, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) on RiceChem and compare their results to GPT models, highlighting the increased complexity of ALAG compared to ASAG.Despite leveraging the benefits of a rubric-based approach and transfer learning from MNLI, the lower performance of LLMs on RiceChem underscores the significant difficulty posed by the ALAG task.With this work, we offer a fresh perspective on grading long, fact-based answers and introduce a new dataset to stimulate further research in this important area.Code: \url{https://github.com/luffycodes/Automated-Long-Answer-Grading}.</p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image search stands as a pivotal task in multimedia and computer vision, finding applications across diverse domains, ranging from internet search to medical diagnostics.Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database.However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall.These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness.To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting.This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration.Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models.To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces YOLOv8-TO, a novel approach for reverse engineering of topology-optimized structures into interpretable geometric parameters using the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model.Density-based topology optimization methods require post-processing to convert the optimal density distribution into a parametric representation for design exploration and integration with CAD tools.Traditional methods such as skeletonization struggle with complex geometries and require manual intervention.YOLOv8-TO addresses these challenges by training a custom YOLOv8 model to automatically detect and reconstruct structural components from binary density distributions.The model is trained on a diverse dataset of both optimized and random structures generated using the Moving Morphable Components method.A custom reconstruction loss function based on the dice coefficient of the predicted geometry is used to train the new regression head of the model via self-supervised learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method is evaluated on test sets generated from different topology optimization methods, including out-of-distribution samples, and compared against a skeletonization approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Results show that YOLOv8-TO significantly outperforms skeletonization in reconstructing visually and structurally similar designs.The method showcases an average improvement of 13.84% in the Dice coefficient, with peak enhancements reaching 20.78%.The method demonstrates good generalization to complex geometries and fast inference times, making it suitable for integration into design workflows using regular workstations.Limitations include the sensitivity to non-max suppression thresholds.YOLOv8-TO represents a significant advancement in topology optimization post-processing, enabling efficient and accurate reverse engineering of optimized structures for design exploration and manufacturing.</p>

                  <p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown excellent performance on various downstream tasks after fine-tuning.Nevertheless, the escalating concerns surrounding user privacy have posed significant challenges to centralized training reliant on extensive data collection.Federated learning(FL), which only requires training on the clients and aggregates weights on the server without sharing data, has emerged as a solution.However, the substantial parameter size of PLMs places a significant burden on the computational resources of client devices, while also leading to costly communication expenses.Introducing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) into FL can effectively address this problem.However, we observe that the non-IID data in federated learning leads to a gap in performance between the PEFT method and full parameter fine-tuning(FT).To overcome this, we propose FeDeRA, an improvement over the LoRA method in FL. FeDeRA uses the same adapter module as LoRA.However, the difference lies in FeDeRA's initialization of the adapter module by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained matrix and selecting its principal components.We conducted extensive experiments, using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3, on three tasks and six datasets, comparing the methods including FT and the other three different PEFT methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FeDeRA outperforms all other PEFT methods and is comparable to or even surpasses the performance of FT methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We also deployed federated learning on Jetson AGX Orin and compared the time required by different methods to achieve the target accuracy on specific tasks.Compared to FT, FeDeRA reduces the training time by 95.9%, 97.9%, 96.9%, and 97.3%, 96.5%, and 96.5% respectively on three tasks using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The overall experiments indicate that FeDeRA achieves good performance while also maintaining efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-language models enable open-world classification of objects without the need for any retraining.While this zero-shot paradigm marks a significant advance, even today's best models exhibit skewed performance when objects are dissimilar from their typical depiction.Real world objects such as pears appear in a variety of forms -- from diced to whole, on a table or in a bowl -- yet standard VLM classifiers map all instances of a class to a \it{single vector based on the class label}.We argue that to represent this rich diversity within a class, zero-shot classification should move beyond a single vector.We propose a method to encode and account for diversity within a class using inferred attributes, still in the zero-shot setting without retraining.We find our method consistently outperforms standard zero-shot classification over a large suite of datasets encompassing hierarchies, diverse object states, and real-world geographic diversity, as well finer-grained datasets where intra-class diversity may be less prevalent.Importantly, our method is inherently interpretable, offering faithful explanations for each inference to facilitate model debugging and enhance transparency.We also find our method scales efficiently to a large number of attributes to account for diversity -- leading to more accurate predictions for atypical instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we characterize a principled trade-off between overall and worst class accuracy, which can be tuned via a hyperparameter of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>We hope this work spurs further research into the promise of zero-shot classification beyond a single class vector for capturing diversity in the world, and building transparent AI systems without compromising performance.</p>

                  <p>The open-world test dataset is often mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, where the deployed models will struggle to make accurate predictions.Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model.In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs.Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection.Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges.First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure.Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs.To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOD Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD and hinges on three innovations: i)An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules; ii) A creative graph generator to construct prototypical graphs that are in line with ID but away from OOD; iii)An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets and six baselines are conducted to demonstrate our superiority. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in off-policy evaluation in the literature such as recommender systems and personalized medicine.We have so far seen significant progress in developing estimators aimed at accurately estimating the effectiveness of counterfactual policies based on biased logged data.However, there are many cases where those estimators are used not only to evaluate the value of decision making policies but also to search for the best hyperparameters from a large candidate space.This work explores the latter hyperparameter optimization (HPO) task for off-policy learning.We empirically show that naively applying an unbiased estimator of the generalization performance as a surrogate objective in HPO can cause an unexpected failure, merely pursuing hyperparameters whose generalization performance is greatly overestimated.We then propose simple and computationally efficient corrections to the typical HPO procedure to deal with the aforementioned issues simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical investigations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HPO algorithm in situations where the typical procedure fails severely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem.However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes.Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes.To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data.In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach.SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS).Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model.3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems.Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems.As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers.One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner.We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them.When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors.This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors.We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>The objective of this paper is motion segmentation -- discovering and segmenting the moving objects in a video.This is a much studied area with numerous careful,and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemes including: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets, object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more.Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task.We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects.In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input.In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentations that maintain object identity.Again, this simple model outperforms previous methods on multiple video object segmentation benchmarks.</p>

FeDeRA uses the same adapter module as LoRA.However, the difference lies in FeDeRA's initialization of the adapter module by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained matrix and selecting its principal components.We conducted extensive experiments, using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3, on three tasks and six datasets, comparing the methods including FT and the other three different PEFT methods.FeDeRA outperforms all other PEFT methods and is comparable to or even surpasses the performance of FT methods.We also deployed federated learning on Jetson AGX Orin and compared the time required by different methods to achieve the target accuracy on specific tasks.Compared to FT, FeDeRA reduces the training time by 95.9%, 97.9%, 96.9%, and 97.3%, 96.5%, and 96.5% respectively on three tasks using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3.The overall experiments indicate that FeDeRA achieves good performance while also maintaining efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning (RSICC) aims to identify surface changes in multi-temporal remote sensing images and describe them in natural language.Current methods typically rely on an encoder-decoder architecture and focus on designing a sophisticated neck to process bi-temporal features extracted by the backbone.Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), especially Mamba, have demonstrated outstanding performance in many fields, owing to their efficient feature-selective modelling capability.However, their potential in the RSICC task remains unexplored.In this paper, we introduce Mamba into RSICC and propose a novel approach called RSCaMa(Remote Sensing Change Captioning Mamba).Specifically, we utilize Siamese backbones to extract bi-temporal features, which are then processed through multiple CaMa layers consisting of Spatial Difference-guided SSM (SD-SSM) and Temporal Traveling SSM (TT-SSM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SD-SSM uses differential features to enhance change perception, while TT-SSM promotes bitemporal interactions in a token-wise cross-scanning manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of CaMa layers and demonstrate the superior performance of RSCaMa, as well as the potential of Mamba in the RSICC task.Additionally, we systematically compare the effects of three language decoders, including Mamba, GPT-style decoder with causal attention mechanism, and Transformer decoder with cross-attention mechanism.This provides valuable insights for future RSICC research.The code will be available at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/RSCaMa</p>

                  <p>We consider the problem of editing 3D objects and scenes based on open-ended language instructions.The established paradigm to solve this problem is to use a 2D image generator or editor to guide the 3D editing process.However, this is often slow as it requires do update a computationally expensive 3D representations such as a neural radiance field, and to do so by using contradictory guidance from a 2D model which is inherently not multi-view consistent.We thus introduce the Direct Gaussian Editor (DGE), a method that addresses these issues in two ways.First, we modify a given high-quality image editor like InstructPix2Pix to be multi-view consistent.We do so by utilizing a training-free approach which integrates cues from the underlying 3D geometry of the scene.Second, given a multi-view consistent edited sequence of images of the object, we directly and efficiently optimize the 3D object representation, which is based on 3D Gaussian Splatting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Because it does not require to apply edits incrementally and iteratively, DGE is significantly more efficient than existing approaches, and comes with other perks such as allowing selective editing of parts of the scene. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>
