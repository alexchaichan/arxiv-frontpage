                  <p>Rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving (AD) tasks turned a significant shift toward end-to-end fashion, particularly in the utilization of vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate robust logical reasoning and cognitive abilities to enable comprehensive end-to-end planning.However, these VLM-based approaches tend to integrate 2D vision tokenizers and a large language model (LLM) for ego-car planning, which lack 3D geometric priors as a cornerstone of reliable planning.Naturally, this observation raises a critical concern: Can a 2D-tokenized LLM accurately perceive the 3D environment?Our evaluation of current VLM-based methods across 3D object detection, vectorized map construction, and environmental caption suggests that the answer is, unfortunately, NO.In other words, 2D-tokenized LLM fails to provide reliable autonomous driving.In response, we introduce DETR-style 3D perceptrons as 3D tokenizers, which connect LLM with a one-layer linear projector.This simple yet elegant strategy, termed Atlas, harnesses the inherent priors of the 3D physical world, enabling it to simultaneously process high-resolution multi-view images and employ spatiotemporal modeling.Despite its simplicity, Atlas demonstrates superior performance in both 3D detection and ego planning tasks on nuScenes dataset, proving that 3D-tokenized LLM is the key to reliable autonomous driving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.895</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote sensing data provide a low-cost solution for large-scale monitoring of air pollution via the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), but is often limited by cloud contamination.Existing methods for AOD reconstruction rely on temporal information.However, for remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, multi-temporal observations are often unavailable.In this letter, we take advantage of deep representation learning from convolutional neural networks and propose Deep Feature Gaussian Processes (DFGP) for single-scene AOD reconstruction.By using deep learning, we transform the variables to a feature space with better explainable power.By using Gaussian processes, we explicitly consider the correlation between observed AOD and missing AOD in spatial and feature domains.Experiments on two AOD datasets with real-world cloud patterns showed that the proposed method outperformed deep CNN and random forest, achieving R$^2$ of 0.7431 on MODIS AOD and R$^2$ of 0.9211 on EMIT AOD, compared to deep CNN's R$^2$ of 0.6507 and R$^2$ of 0.8619.The proposed methods increased R$^2$ by over 0.35 compared to the popular random forest in AOD reconstruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code used in this study are available at \url{https://skrisliu.com/dfgp}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to obtain 3D fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene and is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving.Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources.To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features.We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics.We then propose an efficient Gaussian-to-voxel splatting method to generate 3D occupancy predictions, which only aggregates the neighboring Gaussians for a certain position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianFormer achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods with only 17.8% - 24.8% of their memory consumption.Code is available at: https://github.com/huang-yh/GaussianFormer.</p>

                  <p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set.However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline.To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers.While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100.Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy.Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever.This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).}Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset.Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and link to datasets are available at https://github.com/yc-song/cmc <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems face challenges in handling complex processes and diverse screen layouts that require advanced human-like decision-making capabilities.These systems typically rely on pixel-level encoding through drag-and-drop or automation frameworks such as Selenium to create navigation workflows, rather than visual understanding of screen elements.In this context, we present SmartFlow, an AI-based RPA system that uses pre-trained large language models (LLMs) coupled with deep-learning based image understanding.Our system can adapt to new scenarios, including changes in the user interface and variations in input data, without the need for human intervention.SmartFlow uses computer vision and natural language processing to perceive visible elements on the graphical user interface (GUI) and convert them into a textual representation.This information is then utilized by LLMs to generate a sequence of actions that are executed by a scripting engine to complete an assigned task.To assess the effectiveness of SmartFlow, we have developed a dataset that includes a set of generic enterprise applications with diverse layouts, which we are releasing for research use.Our evaluations on this dataset demonstrate that SmartFlow exhibits robustness across different layouts and applications.SmartFlow can automate a wide range of business processes such as form filling, customer service, invoice processing, and back-office operations.SmartFlow can thus assist organizations in enhancing productivity by automating an even larger fraction of screen-based workflows.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demo-video and dataset are available at https://smartflow-4c5a0a.webflow.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span></p>

                  <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation.SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions.The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications.Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods.This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor.A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images.Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR.We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p>

                  <p>Aerial imagery is increasingly used in Earth science and natural resource management as a complement to labor-intensive ground-based surveys.Aerial systems can collect overlapping images that provide multiple views of each location from different perspectives.However, most prediction approaches (e.g. for tree species classification) use a single, synthesized top-down "orthomosaic" image as input that contains little to no information about the vertical aspects of objects and may include processing artifacts.We propose an alternate approach that generates predictions directly on the raw images and accurately maps these predictions into geospatial coordinates using semantic meshes.This method$\unicode{x2013}$released as a user-friendly open-source toolkit$\unicode{x2013}$enables analysts to use the highest quality data for predictions, capture information about the sides of objects, and leverage multiple viewpoints of each location for added robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the value of this approach on a new benchmark dataset of four forest sites in the western U.S. that consists of drone images, photogrammetry results, predicted tree locations, and species classification data derived from manual surveys. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>We show that our proposed multiview method improves classification accuracy from 53% to 75% relative to an orthomosaic baseline on a challenging cross-site tree species classification task.</p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.This integrated approach yields remarkable results.In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>Suicide is a prominent issue in society.Unfortunately, many people at risk for suicide do not receive the support required.Barriers to people receiving support include social stigma and lack of access to mental health care.With the popularity of social media, people have turned to online forums, such as Reddit to express their feelings and seek support.This provides the opportunity to support people with the aid of artificial intelligence.Social media posts can be classified, using text classification, to help connect people with professional help.However, these systems fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in classifying mental health conditions.Unlike other areas of healthcare, mental health conditions have no objective measurements of disease often relying on expert opinion.Thus when formulating deep learning problems involving mental health, using hard, binary labels does not accurately represent the true nature of the data.In these settings, where human experts may disagree, fuzzy or soft labels may be more appropriate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The current work introduces a novel label smoothing method which we use to capture any uncertainty within the data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our approach on a five-label multi-class classification problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show, our semi-supervised deep label smoothing method improves classification accuracy above the existing state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Where existing research reports an accuracy of 43\% on the Reddit C-SSRS dataset, using empirical experiments to evaluate our novel label smoothing method, we improve upon this existing benchmark to 52\%.These improvements in model performance have the potential to better support those experiencing mental distress.Future work should explore the use of probabilistic methods in both natural language processing and quantifying contributions of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in noisy datasets.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources.Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how.Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links.Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective.The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices.This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT.This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links.We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics.SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), is an extension of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in logistics and transportation.Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers that deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from different locations.Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP such as ridesharing and non-compliance capture.Apart from original objectives like optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness for all parties.Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give up on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts.However, most existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a single side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and utility optimisation concurrently.To this end, we propose a novel framework, a Two-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the genetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to multi-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness.Subsequently, the impact of injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the correlation between any pair of the three objectives are explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video text spotting aims to simultaneously localize, recognize and track text instances in videos.To address the limited recognition capability of end-to-end methods, tracking the zero-shot results of state-of-the-art image text spotters directly can achieve impressive performance.However, owing to the domain gap between different datasets, these methods usually obtain limited tracking trajectories on extreme dataset.Fine-tuning transformer-based text spotters on specific datasets could yield performance enhancements, albeit at the expense of considerable training resources.In this paper, we propose a Language Collaboration and Glyph Perception Model, termed LOGO to enhance the performance of conventional text spotters through the integration of a synergy module.To achieve this goal, a language synergy classifier (LSC) is designed to explicitly discern text instances from background noise in the recognition stage.Specially, the language synergy classifier can output text content or background code based on the legibility of text regions, thus computing language scores.Subsequently, fusion scores are computed by taking the average of detection scores and language scores, and are utilized to re-score the detection results before tracking.By the re-scoring mechanism, the proposed LSC facilitates the detection of low-resolution text instances while filtering out text-like regions.Besides, the glyph supervision and visual position mixture module are proposed to enhance the recognition accuracy of noisy text regions, and acquire more discriminative tracking features, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

We present Hybrid-Parallel, a high-performance distributed inference system optimized for robotic IoT. Hybrid-Parallel employs a fine-grained approach to parallelize inference at the granularity of local operators within DNN layers (i.e., operators that can be computed independently with the partial input, such as the convolution kernel in the convolution layer).By doing so, Hybrid-Parallel enables different operators of different layers to be computed and transmitted concurrently, and overlap the computation and transmission phases within the same inference task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation demonstrate that Hybrid-Parallel reduces inference time by 14.9% ~41.1% and energy consumption per inference by up to 35.3% compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Collaborative fairness stands as an essential element in federated learning to encourage client participation by equitably distributing rewards based on individual contributions.Existing methods primarily focus on adjusting gradient allocations among clients to achieve collaborative fairness.However, they frequently overlook crucial factors such as maintaining consistency across local models and catering to the diverse requirements of high-contributing clients.This oversight inevitably decreases both fairness and model accuracy in practice.To address these issues, we propose FedSAC, a novel Federated learning framework with dynamic Submodel Allocation for Collaborative fairness, backed by a theoretical convergence guarantee.First, we present the concept of "bounded collaborative fairness (BCF)", which ensures fairness by tailoring rewards to individual clients based on their contributions.Second, to implement the BCF, we design a submodel allocation module with a theoretical guarantee of fairness.This module incentivizes high-contributing clients with high-performance submodels containing a diverse range of crucial neurons, thereby preserving consistency across local models.Third, we further develop a dynamic aggregation module to adaptively aggregate submodels, ensuring the equitable treatment of low-frequency neurons and consequently enhancing overall model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmarks demonstrate that FedSAC outperforms all baseline methods in both fairness and model accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>We see this work as a significant step towards incentivizing broader client participation in federated learning.The source code is available at https://github.com/wangzihuixmu/FedSAC.</p>

                  <p>The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities.In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest.However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches.Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated.In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation.In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration.We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data.We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a Finite Element Method-based calibration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time.This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.</p>

                  <p>Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods.Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom.In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically.We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset.Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples.Recent works claim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text classification.In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy annotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning.To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the "noisy" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean.Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity.Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space.Our approach can prevent the selected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up to 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span></p>

                  <p>Coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) are gaining traction thanks to their performance and power efficiency.Utilizing CGRAs to accelerate the execution of tight loops holds great potential for achieving significant overall performance gains, as a substantial portion of program execution time is dedicated to tight loops.But loop parallelization using CGRAs is challenging because of loop-carried data dependencies.Traditionally, loop-carried dependencies are handled by spilling dependent values out of the reconfigurable array to a memory medium and then feeding them back to the grid.Spilling the values and feeding them back into the grid imposes additional latencies and logic that impede performance and limit parallelism.   In this paper, we present the Dependency Resolved CGRA (DR-CGRA) architecture that is designed to accelerate the execution of tight loops.DR-CGRA, which is based on a massively-multithreaded CGRA, runs each iteration as a separate CGRA thread and maps loop-carried data dependencies to inter-thread communication inside the grid.This design ensures the passage of data-dependent values across loop iterations without spilling them out of the grid.

                  <p>Understanding human behavior fundamentally relies on accurate 3D human pose estimation.Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising advancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight architectures.In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is effective.Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where edges in the input graph are missing.To this end, we propose a novel positional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular components from the eigenbasis.Our method involves applying multiple perturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular component from the eigenbasis.PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors.Employing this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model.Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our experimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to $12\%$ on the Human3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one edge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in scenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery.Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data.However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection.To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations.We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements.This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection.Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training.Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance.Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically encode an image into a fixed number of visual tokens (e.g., 576) and process these tokens with a language model.Despite their strong performance, LVLMs face challenges in adapting to varying computational constraints.This raises the question: can we achieve flexibility in the number of visual tokens to suit different tasks and computational resources?We answer this with an emphatic yes.Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, we introduce the Matryoshka Query Transformer (MQT), capable of encoding an image into m visual tokens during inference, where m can be any number up to a predefined maximum.This is achieved by employing a query transformer with M latent query tokens to compress the visual embeddings.During each training step, we randomly select m <= M latent query tokens and train the model using only these first m tokens, discarding the rest.Combining MQT with LLaVA, we train a single model once, and flexibly and drastically reduce the number of inference-time visual tokens while maintaining similar or better performance compared to training independent models for each number of tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model, MQT-LLAVA, matches LLaVA-1.5 performance across 11 benchmarks using a maximum of 256 tokens instead of LLaVA's fixed 576. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Reducing to 16 tokens (8x less TFLOPs) only sacrifices the performance by 2.4 points on MMBench.On certain tasks such as ScienceQA and MMMU, we can even go down to only 2 visual tokens with performance drops of just 3% and 6% each.Our exploration of the trade-off between the accuracy and computational cost brought about by the number of visual tokens facilitates future research to achieve the best of both worlds.</p>

                  <p>We selected 29 medical imaging projects from 48 candidates, assessed 10 software qualities by answering 108 questions for each software project, and interviewed 8 of the 29 development teams.Based on the quantitative data, we ranked the MI software with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).The four top-ranked software products are 3D Slicer, ImageJ, Fiji, and OHIF Viewer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generally, MI software is in a healthy state as shown by the following: we observed 88% of the documentation artifacts recommended by research software development guidelines, 100% of MI projects use version control tools, and developers appear to use the common quasi-agile research software development process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>However, the current state of the practice deviates from the existing guidelines because of the rarity of some recommended artifacts, low usage of continuous integration (17% of the projects), low use of unit testing (about 50% of projects), and room for improvement with documentation (six of nine developers felt their documentation was not clear enough).From interviewing the developers, we identified five pain points and two qualities of potential concern: lack of development time, lack of funding, technology hurdles, ensuring correctness, usability, maintainability, and reproducibility.The interviewees proposed strategies to improve the state of the practice, to address the identified pain points, and to improve software quality.Combining their ideas with ours, we have the following list of recommendations: increase documentation, increase testing by enriching datasets, increase continuous integration usage, move to web applications, employ linters, use peer reviews, design for change, add assurance cases, and incorporate a "Generate All Things" approach.</p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>
