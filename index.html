                  <p>In recent years, the challenge of extracting information from business documents has emerged as a critical task, finding applications across numerous domains.This effort has attracted substantial interest from both industry and academy, highlighting its significance in the current technological landscape.Most datasets in this area are primarily focused on Key Information Extraction (KIE), where the extraction process revolves around extracting information using a specific, predefined set of keys.Unlike most existing datasets and benchmarks, our focus is on discovering key-value pairs (KVPs) without relying on predefined keys, navigating through an array of diverse templates and complex layouts.This task presents unique challenges, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and benchmarks tailored for non-predetermined KVP extraction.To address this gap, we introduce KVP10k , a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed for KVP extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset contains 10707 richly annotated images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>In our benchmark, we also introduce a new challenging task that combines elements of KIE as well as KVP in a single task.KVP10k sets itself apart with its extensive diversity in data and richly detailed annotations, paving the way for advancements in the field of information extraction from complex business documents.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>Comprehending text-rich visual content is paramount for the practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), since text-rich scenarios are ubiquitous in the real world, which are characterized by the presence of extensive texts embedded within images.Recently, the advent of MLLMs with impressive versatility has raised the bar for what we can expect from MLLMs.However, their proficiency in text-rich scenarios has yet to be comprehensively and objectively assessed, since current MLLM benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating general visual comprehension.In this work, we introduce SEED-Bench-2-Plus, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating \textbf{text-rich visual comprehension} of MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark comprises 2.3K multiple-choice questions with precise human annotations, spanning three broad categories: Charts, Maps, and Webs, each of which covers a wide spectrum of text-rich scenarios in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>These categories, due to their inherent complexity and diversity, effectively simulate real-world text-rich environments.We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving 34 prominent MLLMs (including GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision and Claude-3-Opus) and emphasize the current limitations of MLLMs in text-rich visual comprehension.We hope that our work can serve as a valuable addition to existing MLLM benchmarks, providing insightful observations and inspiring further research in the area of text-rich visual comprehension with MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and evaluation code can be accessed at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span></p>

                  <p>Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data.Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing.To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment.To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research.Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback.Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning.Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>Long document question answering (DocQA) aims to answer questions from long documents over 10k words.They usually contain content structures such as sections, sub-sections, and paragraph demarcations.However, the indexing methods of long documents remain under-explored, while existing systems generally employ fixed-length chunking.As they do not consider content structures, the resultant chunks can exclude vital information or include irrelevant content.Motivated by this, we propose the Multi-view Content-aware indexing (MC-indexing) for more effective long DocQA via (i) segment structured document into content chunks, and (ii) represent each content chunk in raw-text, keywords, and summary views.We highlight that MC-indexing requires neither training nor fine-tuning.Having plug-and-play capability, it can be seamlessly integrated with any retrievers to boost their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we propose a long DocQA dataset that includes not only question-answer pair, but also document structure and answer scope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>When compared to state-of-art chunking schemes, MC-indexing has significantly increased the recall by 42.8%, 30.0%, 23.9%, and 16.3% via top k= 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 respectively.These improved scores are the average of 8 widely used retrievers (2 sparse and 6 dense) via extensive experiments.</p>

                  <p>Deepfake speech represents a real and growing threat to systems and society.Many detectors have been created to aid in defense against speech deepfakes.While these detectors implement myriad methodologies, many rely on low-level fragments of the speech generation process.We hypothesize that breath, a higher-level part of speech, is a key component of natural speech and thus improper generation in deepfake speech is a performant discriminator.To evaluate this, we create a breath detector and leverage this against a custom dataset of online news article audio to discriminate between real/deepfake speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we make this custom dataset publicly available to facilitate comparison for future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>Applying our simple breath detector as a deepfake speech discriminator on in-the-wild samples allows for accurate classification (perfect 1.0 AUPRC and 0.0 EER on test data) across 33.6 hours of audio.We compare our model with the state-of-the-art SSL-wav2vec model and show that this complex deep learning model completely fails to classify the same in-the-wild samples (0.72 AUPRC and 0.99 EER).</p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>Increasing the annotation efficiency of trajectory annotations from videos has the potential to enable the next generation of data-hungry tracking algorithms to thrive on large-scale datasets.Despite the importance of this task, there are currently very few works exploring how to efficiently label tracking datasets comprehensively.In this work, we introduce SPAM, a tracking data engine that provides high-quality labels with minimal human intervention.SPAM is built around two key insights: i) most tracking scenarios can be easily resolved.To take advantage of this, we utilize a pre-trained model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, reserving human involvement for a smaller subset of more difficult instances; ii) handling the spatiotemporal dependencies of track annotations across time can be elegantly and efficiently formulated through graphs.Therefore, we use a unified graph formulation to address the annotation of both detections and identity association for tracks across time.Based on these insights, SPAM produces high-quality annotations with a fraction of ground truth labeling cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that trackers trained on SPAM labels achieve comparable performance to those trained on human annotations while requiring only 3-20% of the human labeling effort. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Hence, SPAM paves the way towards highly efficient labeling of large-scale tracking datasets.Our code and models will be available upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution.Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem.When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches.To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation.This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex.Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup.Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states.Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video.However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden.In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram).However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important.To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews.In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player.NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis.Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis.EALD will be available on the open-source platform.</p>

                  <p>Debiased collaborative filtering aims to learn an unbiased prediction model by removing different biases in observational datasets.To solve this problem, one of the simple and effective methods is based on the propensity score, which adjusts the observational sample distribution to the target one by reweighting observed instances.Ideally, propensity scores should be learned with causal balancing constraints.However, existing methods usually ignore such constraints or implement them with unreasonable approximations, which may affect the accuracy of the learned propensity scores.To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first analyze the gaps between the causal balancing requirements and existing methods such as learning the propensity with cross-entropy loss or manually selecting functions to balance.Inspired by these gaps, we propose to approximate the balancing functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that, based on the universal property and representer theorem of kernel functions, the causal balancing constraints can be better satisfied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, we propose an algorithm that adaptively balances the kernel function and theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of our methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and to promote this research direction, we have released our project at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/ICLR24-Kernel-Balancing.</p>

To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs.ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing.We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types.Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats.

                  <p>In this paper, the problem of spectral-efficient communication and computation resource allocation for distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is investigated.In the considered model, multiple RISs are deployed to serve multiple users, while PSC adopts compute-then-transmit protocol to reduce the transmission data size.To support high-rate transmission, the semantic compression ratio, transmit power allocation, and distributed RISs deployment must be jointly considered.This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum semantic-aware transmission rate of the system under total transmit power, phase shift, RIS-user association, and semantic compression ratio constraints.To solve this problem, a many-to-many matching scheme is proposed to solve the RIS-user association subproblem, the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed following greedy policy, while the phase shift of RIS can be optimized using the tensor based beamforming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image search stands as a pivotal task in multimedia and computer vision, finding applications across diverse domains, ranging from internet search to medical diagnostics.Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database.However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall.These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness.To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting.This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration.Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models.To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.</p>

                  <p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown excellent performance on various downstream tasks after fine-tuning.Nevertheless, the escalating concerns surrounding user privacy have posed significant challenges to centralized training reliant on extensive data collection.Federated learning(FL), which only requires training on the clients and aggregates weights on the server without sharing data, has emerged as a solution.However, the substantial parameter size of PLMs places a significant burden on the computational resources of client devices, while also leading to costly communication expenses.Introducing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) into FL can effectively address this problem.However, we observe that the non-IID data in federated learning leads to a gap in performance between the PEFT method and full parameter fine-tuning(FT).To overcome this, we propose FeDeRA, an improvement over the LoRA method in FL. FeDeRA uses the same adapter module as LoRA.However, the difference lies in FeDeRA's initialization of the adapter module by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained matrix and selecting its principal components.We conducted extensive experiments, using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3, on three tasks and six datasets, comparing the methods including FT and the other three different PEFT methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FeDeRA outperforms all other PEFT methods and is comparable to or even surpasses the performance of FT methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We also deployed federated learning on Jetson AGX Orin and compared the time required by different methods to achieve the target accuracy on specific tasks.Compared to FT, FeDeRA reduces the training time by 95.9%, 97.9%, 96.9%, and 97.3%, 96.5%, and 96.5% respectively on three tasks using RoBERTa and DeBERTaV3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The overall experiments indicate that FeDeRA achieves good performance while also maintaining efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited.For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex.We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set.We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2.In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</p>

                  <p>Vision-language models enable open-world classification of objects without the need for any retraining.While this zero-shot paradigm marks a significant advance, even today's best models exhibit skewed performance when objects are dissimilar from their typical depiction.Real world objects such as pears appear in a variety of forms -- from diced to whole, on a table or in a bowl -- yet standard VLM classifiers map all instances of a class to a \it{single vector based on the class label}.We argue that to represent this rich diversity within a class, zero-shot classification should move beyond a single vector.We propose a method to encode and account for diversity within a class using inferred attributes, still in the zero-shot setting without retraining.We find our method consistently outperforms standard zero-shot classification over a large suite of datasets encompassing hierarchies, diverse object states, and real-world geographic diversity, as well finer-grained datasets where intra-class diversity may be less prevalent.Importantly, our method is inherently interpretable, offering faithful explanations for each inference to facilitate model debugging and enhance transparency.We also find our method scales efficiently to a large number of attributes to account for diversity -- leading to more accurate predictions for atypical instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we characterize a principled trade-off between overall and worst class accuracy, which can be tuned via a hyperparameter of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>We hope this work spurs further research into the promise of zero-shot classification beyond a single class vector for capturing diversity in the world, and building transparent AI systems without compromising performance.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state and action spaces remains one of the most challenging problems within the field.Most current learning methods focus on integral identities such as value functions to derive an optimal strategy for the learning agent.In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes.Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators.We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with current theoretical works.Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps.We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DPO is easy to implement, scalable, and shows competitive results on benchmarking experiments against several popular RL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>The open-world test dataset is often mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, where the deployed models will struggle to make accurate predictions.Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model.In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs.Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection.Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges.First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure.Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs.To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOD Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD and hinges on three innovations: i)An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules; ii) A creative graph generator to construct prototypical graphs that are in line with ID but away from OOD; iii)An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets and six baselines are conducted to demonstrate our superiority. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality.However, this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the relationship between primitives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation.On one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives while preserving desired signals.On the other hand, to compensate for the quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights.We demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results.For example, SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.Codes are publicly available at https://runyiyang.github.io/projects/SUNDAE/.</p>

                  <p>Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era.Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage.However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies.Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules.Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity.Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG.It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy.Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules.This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG.Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations.We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations.</p>
