                  <p>It is very challenging to curate a dataset for language-specific knowledge and common sense in order to evaluate natural language understanding capabilities of language models.Due to the limitation in the availability of annotators, most current multilingual datasets are created through translation, which cannot evaluate such language-specific aspects.Therefore, we propose Multilingual CommonsenseQA (mCSQA) based on the construction process of CSQA but leveraging language models for a more efficient construction, e.g., by asking LM to generate questions/answers, refine answers and verify QAs followed by reduced human efforts for verification.Constructed dataset is a benchmark for cross-lingual language-transfer capabilities of multilingual LMs, and experimental results showed high language-transfer capabilities for questions that LMs could easily solve, but lower transfer capabilities for questions requiring deep knowledge or commonsense.This highlights the necessity of language-specific datasets for evaluation and training.Finally, our method demonstrated that multilingual LMs could create QA including language-specific knowledge, significantly reducing the dataset creation cost compared to manual creation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yusuke1997/mCSQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.937</span></span></p>

                  <p>Satellite-based remote sensing has revolutionised the way we address global challenges in a rapidly evolving world.Huge quantities of Earth Observation (EO) data are generated by satellite sensors daily, but processing these large datasets for use in ML pipelines is technically and computationally challenging.Specifically, different types of EO data are often hosted on a variety of platforms, with differing availability for Python preprocessing tools.In addition, spatial alignment across data sources and data tiling can present significant technical hurdles for novice users.While some preprocessed EO datasets exist, their content is often limited to optical or near-optical wavelength data, which is ineffective at night or in adverse weather conditions.Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active sensing technique based on microwave length radiation, offers a viable alternative.However, the application of machine learning to SAR has been limited due to a lack of ML-ready data and pipelines, particularly for the full diversity of SAR data, including polarimetry, coherence and interferometry.We introduce M3LEO, a multi-modal, multi-label EO dataset that includes polarimetric, interferometric, and coherence SAR data derived from Sentinel-1, alongside Sentinel-2 RGB imagery and a suite of labelled tasks for model evaluation.M3LEO spans 17.5TB and contains approximately 10M data chips across six geographic regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is complemented by a flexible PyTorch Lightning framework, with configuration management using Hydra. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide tools to process any dataset available on popular platforms such as Google Earth Engine for integration with our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>Initial experiments validate the utility of our data and framework, showing that SAR imagery contains information additional to that extractable from RGB data.Data at huggingface.co/M3LEO, and code at github.com/spaceml-org/M3LEO.</p>

                  <p>Conversational tones -- the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate -- are essential to effective communication.Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models (LLMs) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans.However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains.Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and GPT-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones.With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4.This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.</p>

                  <p>In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, how to reliably acquire downlink channel state information (CSI) with low overhead is challenging.In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition.Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed.Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning.Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.</p>

                  <p>Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments.However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers.As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning.To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between.We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution.The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system.First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset.Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/AD-H</p>

                  <p>Top-view perspective denotes a typical way in which humans read and reason over different types of maps, and it is vital for localization and navigation of humans as well as of `non-human' agents, such as the ones backed by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs).Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs remain unattested and underexplored.In this work, we thus study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view.The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity.Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases.Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited.Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves.We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages.This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process.In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level.Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts.The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens.Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB.Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of image editing.Existing methods realize various approaches to achieve high-quality image editing, including but not limited to text control, dragging operation, and mask-and-inpainting.Among these, instruction-based editing stands out for its convenience and effectiveness in following human instructions across diverse scenarios.However, it still focuses on simple editing operations like adding, replacing, or deleting, and falls short of understanding aspects of world dynamics that convey the realistic dynamic nature in the physical world.Therefore, this work, EditWorld, introduces a new editing task, namely world-instructed image editing, which defines and categorizes the instructions grounded by various world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We curate a new image editing dataset with world instructions using a set of large pretrained models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Video-LLava and SDXL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>To enable sufficient simulation of world dynamics for image editing, our EditWorld trains model in the curated dataset, and improves instruction-following ability with designed post-edit strategy.Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly outperforms existing editing methods in this new task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/YangLing0818/EditWorld <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels.(2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets.EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts.It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection.This integrated approach yields remarkable results.In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method.Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

                  <p>This study presents a new computational approach for simulating the microbial decomposition of organic matter, from 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of soil.The method employs a valuated graph of connected voxels to simulate transformation and diffusion processes involved in microbial decomposition within the complex soil matrix.The resulting model can be adapted to simulate any diffusion-transformation processes in porous media.We implemented parallelization strategies and explored different numerical methods, including implicit, explicit, synchronous, and asynchronous schemes.To validate our method, we compared simulation outputs with those provided by LBioS and by Mosaic models.LBioS uses a lattice-Boltzmann method for diffusion and Mosaic takes benefit of Pore Network Geometrical Modelling (PNGM) by means of geometrical primitives such as spheres and ellipsoids.This approach achieved comparable results to traditional LBM-based simulations, but required only one-fourth of the computing time.Compared to Mosaic simulation, the proposed method is slower but more accurate and does not require any calibration.Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework and an application example to enhance PNGM-based simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is accomplished by approximating the diffusional conductance coefficients using stochastic gradient descent and data generated by the current approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the performance of source-domain pretrained models when tested on unknown shifted target domains.Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data.Recently, diffusion-driven TTA methods have demonstrated strong performance by using an unconditional diffusion model, which is also trained on the source domain to transform target data into synthetic data as a source domain projection.This allows the source model to make predictions without weight adaptation.In this paper, we argue that the domains of the source model and the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA methods are not aligned.To adapt the source model to the synthetic domain of the unconditional diffusion model, we introduce a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data.Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset.Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning.This process mitigates the potential domain gap between the conditional and unconditional models.Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Diffusion-Driven-Test-Time-Adaptation-via-Synthetic-Domain-Alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods are a family of visual localization methods that directly regress 2D-3D matches for camera pose estimation.They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision.Here, the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points.The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions, etc., but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations.The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes.In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network.We propose GLACE, which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network.Specifically, we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions.Additionally, our position decoder parameterizes the output positions for large-scale scenes more effectively.Without using 3D models or depth maps for supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale scenes with a low-map-size model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On Cambridge landmarks, with a single model, we achieve 17% lower median position error than Poker, the ensemble variant of the state-of-the-art SCR method ACE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/glace.</p>

                  <p>This paper demonstrates a self-supervised approach for learning semantic video representations.Recent vision studies show that a masking strategy for vision and natural language supervision has contributed to developing transferable visual pretraining.Our goal is to achieve a more semantic video representation by leveraging the text related to the video content during the pretraining in a fully self-supervised manner.To this end, we present FILS, a novel self-supervised video Feature prediction In semantic Language Space (FILS).The vision model can capture valuable structured information by correctly predicting masked feature semantics in language space.It is learned using a patch-wise video-text contrastive strategy, in which the text representations act as prototypes for transforming vision features into a language space, which are then used as targets for semantically meaningful feature prediction using our masked encoder-decoder structure.FILS demonstrates remarkable transferability on downstream action recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging egocentric datasets, like Epic-Kitchens, Something-SomethingV2, Charades-Ego, and EGTEA, using ViT-Base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our efficient method requires less computation and smaller batches compared to previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

Hybrid-Parallel employs a fine-grained approach to parallelize inference at the granularity of local operators within DNN layers (i.e., operators that can be computed independently with the partial input, such as the convolution kernel in the convolution layer).By doing so, Hybrid-Parallel enables different operators of different layers to be computed and transmitted concurrently, and overlap the computation and transmission phases within the same inference task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation demonstrate that Hybrid-Parallel reduces inference time by 14.9% ~41.1% and energy consumption per inference by up to 35.3% compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating varied scenarios through simulation is crucial for training and evaluating safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles.Yet, the task of modeling the trajectories of other vehicles to simulate diverse and meaningful close interactions remains prohibitively costly.Adopting language descriptions to generate driving behaviors emerges as a promising strategy, offering a scalable and intuitive method for human operators to simulate a wide range of driving interactions.However, the scarcity of large-scale annotated language-trajectory data makes this approach challenging.   To address this gap, we propose Text-to-Drive (T2D) to synthesize diverse driving behaviors via Large Language Models (LLMs).We introduce a knowledge-driven approach that operates in two stages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the first stage, we employ the embedded knowledge of LLMs to generate diverse language descriptions of driving behaviors for a scene. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we leverage LLM's reasoning capabilities to synthesize these behaviors in simulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At its core, T2D employs an LLM to construct a state chart that maps low-level states to high-level abstractions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>This strategy aids in downstream tasks such as summarizing low-level observations, assessing policy alignment with behavior description, and shaping the auxiliary reward, all without needing human supervision.With our knowledge-driven approach, we demonstrate that T2D generates more diverse trajectories compared to other baselines and offers a natural language interface that allows for interactive incorporation of human preference.Please check our website for more examples: https://text-to-drive.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Motivated by the large progress made by large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML).In contrast to conventional machine learning models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical machine learning problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer.The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a concrete model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why each learner update is performed.We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability and trustworthiness in ML.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited a strong promise in automatically generating executable code from natural language descriptions, particularly with interactive features that allow users to engage in the code-generation process by instructing the LLM with iterative feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing interaction paradigms often assume that users have expert knowledge to debug source code and are not optimized for non-professional programmers' use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises challenges in making interactive code generation more accessible for individuals with varying levels of programming expertise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To tackle these challenges, we present IntelliExplain, which offers a novel human-LLM interaction paradigm to enhance non-professional programmers' experience by enabling them to interact with source code via natural language explanations.Users interact with IntelliExplain by providing natural language corrective feedback on errors they identify from the explanations.Feedback is used by the system to revise the code, until the user is satisfied with explanations by the system of the code.Our user study demonstrates that users with IntelliExplain achieve a significantly higher success rate 11.6% and 25.3% better than with vanilla GPT-3.5, while also requiring 39.0% and 15.6% less time in Text-to-SQL and Python code generation tasks, respectively.</p>
