                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>Auto-regressive models have achieved impressive results in 2D image generation by modeling joint distributions in grid space.In this paper, we extend auto-regressive models to 3D domains, and seek a stronger ability of 3D shape generation by improving auto-regressive models at capacity and scalability simultaneously.Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly available 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It consists of a comprehensive collection of approximately 900,000 objects, with multiple properties of meshes, points, voxels, rendered images, and text captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>This diverse labeled dataset, termed Objaverse-Mix, empowers our model to learn from a wide range of object variations.However, directly applying 3D auto-regression encounters critical challenges of high computational demands on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions, resulting in inferior quality of 3D shapes.To this end, we then present a novel framework Argus3D in terms of capacity.Concretely, our approach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions in a more tractable order.The capacity of conditional generation can thus be realized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent vector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts.In addition, thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our approach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further enhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation.Extensive experiments on four generation tasks demonstrate that Argus3D can synthesize diverse and faithful shapes across multiple categories, achieving remarkable performance.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if specific data was used during the training of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.Specifically, we propose two novel MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an audited model is exposed to data used during its training process.The first architecture is based on a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network and the second one is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).The proposed MINT architectures are evaluated on a challenging face recognition task, considering three state-of-the-art face recognition models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Also, different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context available of the AI model to test.Promising results, up to 90% accuracy, are achieved using our proposed MINT approach, suggesting that it is possible to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data.</p>

                  <p>Food computing brings various perspectives to computer vision like vision-based food analysis for nutrition and health.As a fundamental task in food computing, food detection needs Zero-Shot Detection (ZSD) on novel unseen food objects to support real-world scenarios, such as intelligent kitchens and smart restaurants.Therefore, we first benchmark the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) by introducing FOWA dataset with rich attribute annotations.Unlike ZSD, fine-grained problems in ZSFD like inter-class similarity make synthesized features inseparable.The complexity of food semantic attributes further makes it more difficult for current ZSD methods to distinguish various food categories.To address these problems, we propose a novel framework ZSFDet to tackle fine-grained problems by exploiting the interaction between complex attributes.Specifically, we model the correlation between food categories and attributes in ZSFDet by multi-source graphs to provide prior knowledge for distinguishing fine-grained features.Within ZSFDet, Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) learns knowledge representation from multiple sources (e.g., ingredients correlation from knowledge graph) via the multi-source graph fusion.Conditioned on the fusion of semantic knowledge representation, the region feature diffusion model in KEFS can generate fine-grained features for training the effective zero-shot detector.Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method ZSFDet on FOWA and the widely-used food dataset UECFOOD-256, with significant improvements by 1.8% and 3.7% ZSD mAP compared with the strong baseline RRFS.Further experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO prove that enhancement of the semantic knowledge can also improve the performance on general ZSD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/KEFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes.Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts.This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images.Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models.Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics.The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice.The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</p>

                  <p>Scenario data play a vital role in autonomous driving related researches, and it is essential to obtain refined descriptions and labels to extract and index scenarios with different types of interactions.However, existing methods cannot cope well with the problem of scenario classification and comparison with vehicle interactions as the core.In this paper, we propose a framework for interaction-based refined scenario classification and labeling.Based on the summarized basic types of vehicle interactions, we slice scenario data stream into a series of scenario segments via spatiotemporal scenario evolution tree.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scenario segment statistics of many published scenario datasets are further analyzed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>We also propose the scenario metric Graph-DTW based on Graph Computation Tree and Dynamic Time Warping to conduct refined scenario comparison and labeling.The extreme interactive scenarios and corner cases can be efficiently filtered and extracted.Moreover, testing examples on trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of scenario labeling and the proposed metric.The overall framework can provide solid support for the usage and indexing of scenario data.</p>

                  <p>The availability of a reliable map and a robust localization system is critical for the operation of an autonomous vehicle.In a modern system, both mapping and localization solutions generally employ convolutional neural network (CNN) --based perception.Hence, any algorithm should consider potential errors in perception for safe and robust functioning.In this work, we present uncertainty-aware panoptic Localization and Mapping (uPLAM), which employs perception uncertainty as a bridge to fuse the perception information with classical localization and mapping approaches.We introduce an uncertainty-based map aggregation technique to create a long-term panoptic bird's eye view map and provide an associated mapping uncertainty.Our map consists of surface semantics and landmarks with unique IDs.Moreover, we present panoptic uncertainty-aware particle filter-based localization.To this end, we propose an uncertainty-based particle importance weight calculation for the adaptive incorporation of perception information into localization.We also present a new dataset for evaluating long-term panoptic mapping and map-based localization.Extensive evaluations showcase that our proposed uncertainty incorporation leads to better mapping with reliable uncertainty estimates and accurate localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our dataset and code available at: \url{http://uplam.cs.uni-freiburg.de} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data.However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods.Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues.Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies.This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data.We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages.The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.</p>

We design an algorithm based on approximate linear programming, which solves calibration testing information-theoretically optimally (up to constant factors) in time $O(n^{1.5} \log(n))$. This improves upon state-of-the-art black-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega > 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also develop algorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem, and give sample complexity lower bounds for alternative calibration distances to the one considered in this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Finally, we present preliminary experiments showing that the testing problem we define faithfully captures standard notions of calibration, and that our algorithms scale to accommodate moderate sample sizes.</p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity.</p>

                  <p>Clinical calculators play a vital role in healthcare by offering accurate evidence-based predictions for various purposes such as prognosis.Nevertheless, their widespread utilization is frequently hindered by usability challenges, poor dissemination, and restricted functionality.Augmenting large language models with extensive collections of clinical calculators presents an opportunity to overcome these obstacles and improve workflow efficiency, but the scalability of the manual curation process poses a significant challenge.In response, we introduce AgentMD, a novel language agent capable of curating and applying clinical calculators across various clinical contexts.Using the published literature, AgentMD has automatically curated a collection of 2,164 diverse clinical calculators with executable functions and structured documentation, collectively named RiskCalcs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Manual evaluations show that RiskCalcs tools achieve an accuracy of over 80% on three quality metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>At inference time, AgentMD can automatically select and apply the relevant RiskCalcs tools given any patient description.On the newly established RiskQA benchmark, AgentMD significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4 (87.7% vs. 40.9% in accuracy).Additionally, we also applied AgentMD to real-world clinical notes for analyzing both population-level and risk-level patient characteristics.In summary, our study illustrates the utility of language agents augmented with clinical calculators for healthcare analytics and patient care.</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, and alignment.Using pairs of preferred and dispreferred data, DPO models the \textit{relative} probability of picking one response over another.In this work, first we show theoretically that the standard DPO loss can lead to a \textit{reduction} of the model's likelihood of the preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between the preferred and dispreferred classes increases.We then show empirically that this phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especially datasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low.Using these insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and training procedure which avoids this failure mode.Surprisingly, we also find that DPOP significantly outperforms DPO across a wide variety of datasets and downstream tasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions.By fine-tuning with DPOP, we create and release Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, which achieve state-of-the-art open-source performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, Smaug-72B is nearly 2\% better than any other open-source model on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and becomes the first open-source LLM to surpass an average accuracy of 80\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Compared with static knowledge graphs, temporal knowledge graphs (tKG), which can capture the evolution and change of information over time, are more realistic and general.However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem.In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning.By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model.We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different.In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>The fairness-aware online learning framework has emerged as a potent tool within the context of continuous lifelong learning.In this scenario, the learner's objective is to progressively acquire new tasks as they arrive over time, while also guaranteeing statistical parity among various protected sub-populations, such as race and gender, when it comes to the newly introduced tasks.A significant limitation of current approaches lies in their heavy reliance on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption concerning data, leading to a static regret analysis of the framework.Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that achieving low static regret does not necessarily translate to strong performance in dynamic environments characterized by tasks sampled from diverse distributions.In this paper, to tackle the fairness-aware online learning challenge in evolving settings, we introduce a unique regret measure, FairSAR, by incorporating long-term fairness constraints into a strongly adapted loss regret framework.Moreover, to determine an optimal model parameter at each time step, we introduce an innovative adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, referred to as FairSAOML.This algorithm possesses the ability to adjust to dynamic environments by effectively managing bias control and model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The problem is framed as a bi-level convex-concave optimization, considering both the model's primal and dual parameters, which pertain to its accuracy and fairness attributes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Theoretical analysis yields sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and the cumulative violation of fairness constraints.Our experimental evaluation on various real-world datasets in dynamic environments demonstrates that our proposed FairSAOML algorithm consistently outperforms alternative approaches rooted in the most advanced prior online learning methods.</p>

                  <p>With the exponential growth of the life science literature, biomedical text mining (BTM) has become an essential technology for accelerating the extraction of insights from publications.Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents.However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed.Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type.This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications.Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training.Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types.Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust.</p>

                  <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated significant success.Active learning for GNNs aims to query the valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation to maximize the GNNs' performance at a low cost.However, most existing methods for reinforced active learning in GNNs may lead to a highly imbalanced class distribution, especially in highly skewed class scenarios.This further adversely affects the classification performance.To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel reinforced class-balanced active learning framework for GNNs, namely, GraphCBAL.It learns an optimal policy to acquire class-balanced and informative nodes for annotation, maximizing the performance of GNNs trained with selected labeled nodes.GraphCBAL designs class-balance-aware states, as well as a reward function that achieves trade-off between model performance and class balance.We further upgrade GraphCBAL to GraphCBAL++ by introducing a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>In particular, our methods can strike the balance between classification results and class balance.</p>

                  <p>Countries worldwide have been implementing different actions national strategies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to shape policy priorities and guide their development concerning AI.Several AI indices have emerged to assess countries' progress in AI development, aiding decision-making on investments and policy choices.Typically, these indices combine multiple indicators using linear additive methods such as weighted sums, although they are limited in their ability to account for interactions among indicators.Another limitation concerns the use of deterministic weights, which can be perceived as subjective and vulnerable to debate and scrutiny, especially by nations that feel disadvantaged.Aiming at mitigating these problems, we conduct a methodological analysis to derive AI indices based on multiple criteria decision analysis.Initially, we assess correlations between different AI dimensions and employ the Choquet integral to model them.Thus, we apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to conduct a sensitivity analysis using both weighted sum and Choquet integral in order to evaluate the stability of the indices with regard the weights.Finally, we introduce a novel ranking methodology based on SMAA, which considers several sets of weights to derive the ranking of countries.As a result, instead of using predefined weights, in the proposed approach, the ranking is achieved based on the probabilities of countries in occupying a specific position.In the computational analysis, we utilize the data employed in The Global AI Index proposed by Tortoise.Results reveal correlations in the data, and our approach effectively mitigates bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the sensitivity analysis, we scrutinize changes in the ranking resulting from weight adjustments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our proposal rankings closely align with those derived from weight variations, proving to be more robust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, one-stage detectors have achieved competitive accuracy and faster speed compared with traditional two-stage detectors on image data.However, in the field of video object detection (VOD), most existing VOD methods are still based on two-stage detectors.Moreover, directly adapting existing VOD methods to one-stage detectors introduces unaffordable computational costs.In this paper, we first analyse the computational bottlenecks of using one-stage detectors for VOD.Based on the analysis, we present a simple yet efficient framework to address the computational bottlenecks and achieve efficient one-stage VOD by exploiting the temporal consistency in video frames.Specifically, our method consists of a location-prior network to filter out background regions and a size-prior network to skip unnecessary computations on low-level feature maps for specific frames.We test our method on various modern one-stage detectors and conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Excellent experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/guanxiongsun/vfe.pytorch.</p>

                  <p>Deep video models, for example, 3D CNNs or video transformers, have achieved promising performance on sparse video tasks, i.e., predicting one result per video.However, challenges arise when adapting existing deep video models to dense video tasks, i.e., predicting one result per frame.Specifically, these models are expensive for deployment, less effective when handling redundant frames, and difficult to capture long-range temporal correlations.To overcome these issues, we propose a Temporal Dilated Video Transformer (TDViT) that consists of carefully designed temporal dilated transformer blocks (TDTB).TDTB can efficiently extract spatiotemporal representations and effectively alleviate the negative effect of temporal redundancy.Furthermore, by using hierarchical TDTBs, our approach obtains an exponentially expanded temporal receptive field and therefore can model long-range dynamics.Extensive experiments are conducted on two different dense video benchmarks, i.e., ImageNet VID for video object detection and YouTube VIS for video instance segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Excellent experimental results demonstrate the superior efficiency, effectiveness, and compatibility of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/guanxiongsun/vfe.pytorch.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS).The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves.We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 12 different LLMs.Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs.(2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance.(3) A very limited number of predecessor steps following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance.(4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend.We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this study, we introduce "CosmoAgent," an innovative artificial intelligence framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations, with a special emphasis on Stephen Hawking's cautionary advice about not sending radio signals haphazardly into the universe.The goal is to assess the feasibility of peaceful coexistence while considering potential risks that could threaten well-intentioned civilizations.Employing mathematical models and state transition matrices, our approach quantitatively evaluates the development trajectories of civilizations, offering insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation.Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among various civilizations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLMs with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>This innovative research provides a new way to understand complex inter-civilizational dynamics, expanding our perspective while pioneering novel strategies for conflict resolution, crucial for preventing interstellar conflicts.We have also released the code and datasets to enable further academic investigation into this interesting area of research.The code is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AlienAgent.</p>

                  <p>Many models that leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in question answering (QA) tasks.In the real world, many facts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has received increasing attention.Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models in temporal KGQA, they still have several limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(I) They adopt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend to focus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporal constraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations of entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>(II)They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities nor explicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make it difficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering.To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling (QC-MHM) approach.Specifically, We first calibrate the question representation by fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG.Then, we construct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing.Finally, the question representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN to generate the final prediction.Empirical results verify that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmark dataset.Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestions dataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% compared to the best-performing baseline.Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretable and trustworthy predictions.</p>
