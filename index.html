                  <p>Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems.One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL).While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges.First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner.This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task.Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task.To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks.We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity.For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, yet their potential in more challenging and domain-specific task, such as finance, has not been fully explored.In this paper, we present CFinBench: a meticulously crafted, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark to date, for assessing the financial knowledge of LLMs under Chinese context.In practice, to better align with the career trajectory of Chinese financial practitioners, we build a systematic evaluation from 4 first-level categories: (1) Financial Subject: whether LLMs can memorize the necessary basic knowledge of financial subjects, such as economics, statistics and auditing.(2) Financial Qualification: whether LLMs can obtain the needed financial qualified certifications, such as certified public accountant, securities qualification and banking qualification.(3) Financial Practice: whether LLMs can fulfill the practical financial jobs, such as tax consultant, junior accountant and securities analyst.(4) Financial Law: whether LLMs can meet the requirement of financial laws and regulations, such as tax law, insurance law and economic law.CFinBench comprises 99,100 questions spanning 43 second-level categories with 3 question types: single-choice, multiple-choice and judgment.We conduct extensive experiments of 50 representative LLMs with various model size on CFinBench.The results show that GPT4 and some Chinese-oriented models lead the benchmark, with the highest average accuracy being 60.16%, highlighting the challenge presented by CFinBench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://cfinbench.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

                  <p>Paraphrases represent a human's intuitive ability to understand expressions presented in various different ways.Current paraphrase evaluations of language models primarily use binary approaches, offering limited interpretability of specific text changes.Atomic paraphrase types (APT) decompose paraphrases into different linguistic changes and offer a granular view of the flexibility in linguistic expression (e.g., a shift in syntax or vocabulary used).In this study, we assess the human preferences towards ChatGPT in generating English paraphrases with ten APTs and five prompting techniques.We introduce APTY (Atomic Paraphrase TYpes), a dataset of 500 sentence-level and word-level annotations by 15 annotators.The dataset also provides a human preference ranking of paraphrases with different types that can be used to fine-tune models with RLHF and DPO methods.Our results reveal that ChatGPT can generate simple APTs, such as additions and deletions, but struggle with complex structures (e.g., subordination changes).This study contributes to understanding which aspects of paraphrasing language models have already succeeded at understanding and what remains elusive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, our curated datasets can be used to develop language models with specific linguistic capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to our interaction with digital devices.Recently, growing efforts have been made to build models for various GUI understanding tasks.However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (SPR) task.This task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the SPR task.Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree.Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements.Such layout information is crucial for accurately interpreting information on the screen, distinguishing our ToL agent from other screen reading tools.We also thoroughly evaluate the ToL agent against other baselines on a newly proposed SPR benchmark, which includes GUIs from mobile, web, and operating systems.Last but not least, we test the ToL agent on mobile GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating its utility in identifying incorrect actions along the path of agent execution trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data: screen-point-and-read.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Thoroughly testing autonomy systems is crucial in the pursuit of safe autonomous driving vehicles.It necessitates creating safety-critical scenarios that go beyond what can be safely collected from real-world data, as many of these scenarios occur infrequently on public roads.However, the evaluation of most existing NVS methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground truth images using metrics.Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations.Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world.To address this, this paper presents a novel driving view synthesis dataset and benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is unique as it includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by 1-4 meters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It comprises six sequences encompassing various time and weather conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each sequence contains 450 training images, 150 testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span>Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multi-camera settings.The experimental findings underscore the significant gap that exists in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is released publicly at the project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span></p>

                  <p>We propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation benchmark, ChronoMagic-Bench, to evaluate the temporal and metamorphic capabilities of the T2V models (e.g. Sora and Lumiere) in time-lapse video generation.In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on the visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence.The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query.For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories.This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations.To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence.MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity.Based on the ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce MultiDiff, a novel approach for consistent novel view synthesis of scenes from a single RGB image.The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature, as there exist multiple, plausible explanations for unobserved areas.To address this issue, we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models.Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views, increasing geometric stability.The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes, allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images.In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation, MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements, while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude.For additional consistency and image quality improvements, we introduce a novel, structured noise distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate that MultiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging, real-world datasets RealEstate10K and ScanNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Finally, our model naturally supports multi-view consistent editing without the need for further tuning.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data.The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

These inputs implicitly define the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ given by $K[i,j] = f(x^{(i)}, y^{(j)})$.The goal is to compute a vector $v$ which approximates $K w$ with $|| Kw - v||_\infty <\varepsilon ||w||_1$.A recent line of work has proved fine-grained lower bounds conditioned on SETH.Backurs et al.first showed the hardness of KDE for Gaussian-like kernels with high dimension $m = \Omega(\log n)$ and large scale $B = \Omega(\log n)$. Alman et al. later developed new reductions in roughly this same parameter regime, leading to lower bounds for more general kernels, but only for very small error $\varepsilon < 2^{- \log^{\Omega(1)} (n)}$.

Our new lower bounds make use of an intricate analysis of a special case of the kernel matrix -- the `counting matrix'.As a key technical lemma, we give a novel approach to bounding the entries of its inverse by using Schur polynomials from algebraic combinatorics.</p>

                  <p>This letter investigates the secret communication problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the legitimate transmitter transmits an information-bearing signal to the legitimate receiver, and at the same time, transmits a jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve).Unlike the conventional jamming scheme, which usually transmits Gaussian noise that interferes not only with Eve but also with the legitimate receiver, in this letter, we consider that encoded codewords are transmitted to jam Eve.Then, by employing appropriate coding schemes, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the jamming signal and then cancel the interference, while Eve cannot, even if it knows the codebooks.We aim to maximize the secrecy rate through port selection and power control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the problem is non-convex, we show that the optimal solution can be found. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Simulation results show that by using the FAS technique and the proposed jamming scheme, the secrecy rate of the system can be significantly increased.</p>

                  <p>The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts.Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -- specifically large language models (LLMs) -- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs.Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications.However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.   In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains.To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models have transformed ML/AI development, necessitating a reevaluation of AutoML principles for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.To address the challenges of hyper-parameter optimization and online adaptation in RAG, we propose the AutoRAG-HP framework, which formulates the hyper-parameter tuning as an online multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and introduces a novel two-level Hierarchical MAB (Hier-MAB) method for efficient exploration of large search spaces.We conduct extensive experiments on tuning hyper-parameters, such as top-k retrieved documents, prompt compression ratio, and embedding methods, using the ALCE-ASQA and Natural Questions datasets.Our evaluation from jointly optimization all three hyper-parameters demonstrate that MAB-based online learning methods can achieve Recall@5 $\approx 0.8$ for scenarios with prominent gradients in search space, using only $\sim20\%$ of the LLM API calls required by the Grid Search approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the proposed Hier-MAB approach outperforms other baselines in more challenging optimization scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>The code will be made available at https://aka.ms/autorag.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show amazing performance on many domain-specific tasks after fine-tuning with some appropriate data.However, many domain-specific data are privately distributed across multiple owners.Thus, this dilemma raises the interest in how to perform LLM fine-tuning in federated learning (FL).However, confronted with limited computation and communication capacities, FL clients struggle to fine-tune an LLM effectively.To this end, we introduce FedBiOT, a resource-efficient LLM fine-tuning approach to FL.Specifically, our method involves the server generating a compressed LLM and aligning its performance with the full model.Subsequently, the clients fine-tune a lightweight yet important part of the compressed model, referred to as an adapter.Notice that as the server has no access to the private data owned by the clients, the data used for alignment by the server has a different distribution from the one used for fine-tuning by clients.We formulate the problem into a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the negative effect of data discrepancy and derive the updating rules for the server and clients.We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-2, empirically showing that the adapter has exceptional performance when reintegrated into the global LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results also indicate that the proposed FedBiOT significantly reduces resource consumption compared to existing benchmarks, all while achieving comparable performance levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many.One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature.Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature.However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence.We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases.We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102).Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84.We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews.Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings.In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution.Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Ann. Probab. 1982] provided an upper bound on the worst-case approximation ratio that was later matched by an algorithm of Correa et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>[Math. Oper.Res. 2021].The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy.A similar result for $k>1$ has remained elusive.   In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality.To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</p>

We thus propose to consider the acquisition process from a signal-processing perspective.Given an object's geometry and a lighting environment, we estimate the properties of the materials on the object's surface in seconds.We do so by leveraging frequency domain analysis, considering the recovery of material properties as a deconvolution, enabling fast error estimation.We then quantify the uncertainty of the estimation, based on the available data, highlighting the areas for which priors or additional samples would be required for improved acquisition quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our approach to previous work and quantitatively evaluate our results, showing similar quality as previous work in a fraction of the time, and providing key information about the certainty of the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a two-phase training approach where pre-trained large language models are continually pre-trained on parallel data and then supervised fine-tuned with a small amount of high-quality parallel data.To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted continual pre-training with a 3.8B-parameter model and parallel data across eight different formats.We evaluate these methods on thirteen test sets for Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translation.The results demonstrate that when utilizing parallel data in continual pre-training, it is essential to alternate between source and target sentences.Additionally, we demonstrated that the translation accuracy improves only for translation directions where the order of source and target sentences aligns between continual pre-training data and inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we demonstrate that the LLM-based translation model is more robust in translating spoken language and achieves higher accuracy with less training data compared to supervised encoder-decoder models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We also show that the highest accuracy is achieved when the data for continual pre-training consists of interleaved source and target sentences and when tags are added to the source sentences.</p>

                  <p>Protein sequence design, determined by amino acid sequences, are essential to protein engineering problems in drug discovery.Prior approaches have resorted to evolutionary strategies or Monte-Carlo methods for protein design, but often fail to exploit the structure of the combinatorial search space, to generalize to unseen sequences.In the context of discrete black box optimization over large search spaces, learning a mutation policy to generate novel sequences with reinforcement learning is appealing.Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) trained on large corpora of protein sequences offer a potential solution to this problem by scoring proteins according to their biological plausibility (such as the TM-score).In this work, we propose to use PLMs as a reward function to generate new sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet the PLM can be computationally expensive to query due to its large size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>To this end, we propose an alternative paradigm where optimization can be performed on scores from a smaller proxy model that is periodically finetuned, jointly while learning the mutation policy.We perform extensive experiments on various sequence lengths to benchmark RL-based approaches, and provide comprehensive evaluations along biological plausibility and diversity of the protein.Our experimental results include favorable evaluations of the proposed sequences, along with high diversity scores, demonstrating that RL is a strong candidate for biological sequence design.Finally, we provide a modular open source implementation can be easily integrated in most RL training loops, with support for replacing the reward model with other PLMs, to spur further research in this domain.The code for all experiments is provided in the supplementary material.</p>

In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics.Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations.Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees.Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document.Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates.We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</p>

To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>
