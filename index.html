                  <p>S\'ami, an indigenous language group comprising multiple languages, faces digital marginalization due to the limited availability of data and sophisticated language models designed for its linguistic intricacies.This work focuses on increasing technological participation for the S\'ami language.We draw the attention of the ML community towards the language modeling problem of Ultra Low Resource (ULR) languages.ULR languages are those for which the amount of available textual resources is very low, and the speaker count for them is also very low.ULRLs are also not supported by mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, due to which gathering artificial training data for them becomes even more challenging.Mainstream AI foundational model development has given less attention to this category of languages.Generally, these languages have very few speakers, making it hard to find them.However, it is important to develop foundational models for these ULR languages to promote inclusion and the tangible abilities and impact of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we have compiled the available S\'ami language resources from the web to create a clean dataset for training language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>In order to study the behavior of modern LLM models with ULR languages (S\'ami), we have experimented with different kinds of LLMs, mainly at the order of $\sim$ seven billion parameters.We have also explored the effect of multilingual LLM training for ULRLs.We found that the decoder-only models under a sequential multilingual training scenario perform better than joint multilingual training, whereas multilingual training with high semantic overlap, in general, performs better than training from scratch.This is the first study on the S\'ami language for adapting non-statistical language models that use the latest developments in the field of natural language processing (NLP).</p>

                  <p>Knowing the locations of nearby moving objects is important for a mobile robot to operate safely in a dynamic environment.Dynamic object tracking performance can be improved if robots share observations of tracked objects with nearby team members in real-time.To share observations, a robot must make up-to-date estimates of the transformation from its coordinate frame to the frame of each neighbor, which can be challenging because of odometry drift.We present Multiple Object Tracking with Localization Error Elimination (MOTLEE), a complete system for a multi-robot team to accurately estimate frame transformations and collaboratively track dynamic objects.To accomplish this, robots use open-set image-segmentation methods to build object maps of their environment and then use our Temporally Consistent Alignment of Frames Filter (TCAFF) to align maps and estimate coordinate frame transformations without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses.We show that our method for aligning frames enables a team of four robots to collaboratively track six pedestrians with accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization in a challenging hardware demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/motlee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a rapidly growing research field with the potential to revolutionize typical photogrammetric workflows, such as those used for 3D scene reconstruction.As input, NeRFs require multi-view images with corresponding camera poses as well as the interior orientation.In the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM).But the quality of the resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict.In addition, SfM is a time-consuming pre-processing step, and its quality strongly depends on the image content.Furthermore, the undefined scaling factor of SfM hinders subsequent steps in which metric information is required.In this paper, we evaluate the potential of NeRFs for industrial robot applications.We propose an alternative to SfM pre-processing: we capture the input images with a calibrated camera that is attached to the end effector of an industrial robot and determine accurate camera poses with metric scale based on the robot kinematics.We then investigate the quality of the novel views by comparing them to ground truth, and by computing an internal quality measure based on ensemble methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluation purposes, we acquire multiple datasets that pose challenges for reconstruction typical of industrial applications, like reflective objects, poor texture, and fine structures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>We show that the robot-based pose determination reaches similar accuracy as SfM in non-demanding cases, while having clear advantages in more challenging scenarios.Finally, we present first results of applying the ensemble method to estimate the quality of the synthetic novel view in the absence of a ground truth.</p>

                  <p>Rapid progress in text-to-image generative models coupled with their deployment for visual content creation has magnified the importance of thoroughly evaluating their performance and identifying potential biases.In pursuit of models that generate images that are realistic, diverse, visually appealing, and consistent with the given prompt, researchers and practitioners often turn to automated metrics to facilitate scalable and cost-effective performance profiling.However, commonly-used metrics often fail to account for the full diversity of human preference; often even in-depth human evaluations face challenges with subjectivity, especially as interpretations of evaluation criteria vary across regions and cultures.In this work, we conduct a large, cross-cultural study to study how much annotators in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia vary in their perception of geographic representation, visual appeal, and consistency in real and generated images from state-of-the art public APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect over 65,000 image annotations and 20 survey responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>We contrast human annotations with common automated metrics, finding that human preferences vary notably across geographic location and that current metrics do not fully account for this diversity.For example, annotators in different locations often disagree on whether exaggerated, stereotypical depictions of a region are considered geographically representative.In addition, the utility of automatic evaluations is dependent on assumptions about their set-up, such as the alignment of feature extractors with human perception of object similarity or the definition of "appeal" captured in reference datasets used to ground evaluations.We recommend steps for improved automatic and human evaluations.</p>

                  <p>Image safety classifiers play an important role in identifying and mitigating the spread of unsafe images online (e.g., images including violence, hateful rhetoric, etc.).At the same time, with the advent of text-to-image models and increasing concerns about the safety of AI models, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to safeguard their models.Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for real-world and AI-generated images.To bridge this research gap, in this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models.Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough in mitigating the multifaceted problem of unsafe images.Also, we find that classifiers trained only on real-world images tend to have degraded performance when applied to AI-generated images.Motivated by these findings, we design and implement a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which effectively identifies 11 categories of real-world and AI-generated unsafe images.The best PerspectiveVision model achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.810 on six evaluation datasets, which is comparable with closed-source and expensive state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</p>

                  <p>Recent works in hand-object reconstruction mainly focus on the single-view and dense multi-view settings.On the one hand, single-view methods can leverage learned shape priors to generalise to unseen objects but are prone to inaccuracies due to occlusions.On the other hand, dense multi-view methods are very accurate but cannot easily adapt to unseen objects without further data collection.In contrast, sparse multi-view methods can take advantage of the additional views to tackle occlusion, while keeping the computational cost low compared to dense multi-view methods.In this paper, we consider the problem of hand-object reconstruction with unseen objects in the sparse multi-view setting.Given multiple RGB images of the hand and object captured at the same time, our model SVHO combines the predictions from each view into a unified reconstruction without optimisation across views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our model on a synthetic hand-object dataset and evaluate directly on a real world recorded hand-object dataset with unseen objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>We show that while reconstruction of unseen hands and objects from RGB is challenging, additional views can help improve the reconstruction quality.</p>

                  <p>The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks.However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved.The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective.In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks.Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points.We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks.We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2.Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in human-populated environments.State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment.In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s.We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene.This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation.We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>Suicide is a prominent issue in society.Unfortunately, many people at risk for suicide do not receive the support required.Barriers to people receiving support include social stigma and lack of access to mental health care.With the popularity of social media, people have turned to online forums, such as Reddit to express their feelings and seek support.This provides the opportunity to support people with the aid of artificial intelligence.Social media posts can be classified, using text classification, to help connect people with professional help.However, these systems fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in classifying mental health conditions.Unlike other areas of healthcare, mental health conditions have no objective measurements of disease often relying on expert opinion.Thus when formulating deep learning problems involving mental health, using hard, binary labels does not accurately represent the true nature of the data.In these settings, where human experts may disagree, fuzzy or soft labels may be more appropriate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The current work introduces a novel label smoothing method which we use to capture any uncertainty within the data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our approach on a five-label multi-class classification problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show, our semi-supervised deep label smoothing method improves classification accuracy above the existing state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Where existing research reports an accuracy of 43\% on the Reddit C-SSRS dataset, using empirical experiments to evaluate our novel label smoothing method, we improve upon this existing benchmark to 52\%.These improvements in model performance have the potential to better support those experiencing mental distress.Future work should explore the use of probabilistic methods in both natural language processing and quantifying contributions of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in noisy datasets.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>While effective in practice, iterative methods for solving large systems of linear equations can be significantly affected by problem-dependent condition number quantities.This makes characterizing their time complexity challenging, particularly when we wish to make comparisons between deterministic and stochastic methods, that may or may not rely on preconditioning and/or fast matrix multiplication.In this work, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for iterative linear solvers which we call the spectral tail condition number, $\kappa_\ell$, defined as the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of the matrix representing the system.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we prove the following main algorithmic result: Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, we can find $\tilde{x}$ such that $\|A\tilde{x}-b\|\leq\epsilon\|b\|$ in time $\tilde{O}(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$ for any $\ell = O(n^{\frac1{\omega-1}})=O(n^{0.729})$, where $\omega \approx 2.372$ is the current fast matrix multiplication exponent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>This guarantee is achieved by Sketch-and-Project with Nesterov's acceleration.Some of the implications of our result, and of the use of $\kappa_\ell$, include direct improvement over a fine-grained analysis of the Conjugate Gradient method, suggesting a stronger separation between deterministic and stochastic iterative solvers; and relating the complexity of iterative solvers to the ongoing algorithmic advances in fast matrix multiplication, since the bound on $\ell$ improves with $\omega$.   Our main technical contributions are new sharp characterizations for the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that commonly arises in sketching algorithms, building on a combination of techniques from combinatorial sampling via determinantal point processes and Gaussian universality results from random matrix theory.</p>

                  <p>We study fundamental directed graph (digraph) problems in the streaming model.An initial investigation by Chakrabarti, Ghosh, McGregor, and Vorotnikova [SODA'20] on streaming digraphs showed that while most of these problems are provably hard in general, some of them become tractable when restricted to the well-studied class of tournament graphs where every pair of nodes shares exactly one directed edge.Thus, we focus on tournaments and improve the state of the art for multiple problems in terms of both upper and lower bounds.   Our primary upper bound is a deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm (using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space for $n$-node graphs, where $\tilde{O}(.)$ hides polylog$(n)$ factors) for decomposing a tournament into strongly connected components (SCC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>it improves upon the previously best-known algorithm by Baweja, Jia, and Woodruff <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>[ITCS'22] in terms of both space and passes: for $p\geq 1$, they used $(p+1)$-passes and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/p})$-space.We further extend our algorithm to digraphs that are close to tournaments and establish tight bounds demonstrating that the problem's complexity grows smoothly with the "distance" from tournaments.Applying our framework, we obtain improved tournament algorithms for $s,t$-reachability, strong connectivity, Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and feedback arc set.   On the other hand, we prove the first $\Omega(n^2)$-space lower bounds for this class, exhibiting that some well-studied problems -- such as (exact) feedback arc set on tournaments (FAST) and $s,t$-distance -- remain hard here.We obtain a generalized lower bound on space-approximation tradeoffs for FAST: any single-pass $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm requires $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ space.As a whole, our collection of results contributes significantly to the growing literature on streaming digraphs.</p>

                  <p>Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in a way that is undetectable to the human eye.To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer.The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image.However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks.To improve the robustness of the algorithm against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder.The module is aimed at reducing noise and recovering some of the information lost during an attack.Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.</p>

                  <p>Traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods typically require preserving the entire knowledge graph (KG) with significant training costs when new knowledge emerges.To address this issue, the continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) task has been proposed to train the KGE model by learning emerging knowledge efficiently while simultaneously preserving decent old knowledge.However, the explicit graph structure in KGs, which is critical for the above goal, has been heavily ignored by existing CKGE methods.On the one hand, existing methods usually learn new triples in a random order, destroying the inner structure of new KGs.On the other hand, old triples are preserved with equal priority, failing to alleviate catastrophic forgetting effectively.In this paper, we propose a competitive method for CKGE based on incremental distillation (IncDE), which considers the full use of the explicit graph structure in KGs.First, to optimize the learning order, we introduce a hierarchical strategy, ranking new triples for layer-by-layer learning.By employing the inter- and intra-hierarchical orders together, new triples are grouped into layers based on the graph structure features.Secondly, to preserve the old knowledge effectively, we devise a novel incremental distillation mechanism, which facilitates the seamless transfer of entity representations from the previous layer to the next one, promoting old knowledge preservation.Finally, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm to avoid the over-corruption of old knowledge influenced by under-trained new knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IncDE over state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the incremental distillation mechanism contributes to improvements of 0.2%-6.5% in the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference.Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4.Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving.We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs.To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache.QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores.Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM.Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization.In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency.We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization.As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM.Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100.Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/qserve.</p>

                  <p>Context.Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development.Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software.However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools.Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.   Goal.In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.   Method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.   Results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand.Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart.Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.   Conclusions.According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so.Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

Methods We conducted a large-scale textual analysis using a dataset comprising diverse web sources, including Arxiv, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl.The study analyzed the context in which various diseases are discussed alongside markers of race and gender.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given that LLMs are pre-trained on similar datasets, this approach allowed us to examine the potential biases that LLMs may learn and internalize. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>We compared these findings with actual demographic disease prevalence as well as GPT-4 outputs in order to evaluate the extent of bias representation.

Furthermore, the attention {\it training forward} and {\it backward gradient} can be computed in $n^{1+o(1)}$ as well.Our approach can avoid explicitly computing the $n \times n$ attention matrix, which may largely alleviate the quadratic computational complexity.Furthermore, our algorithm works on any input matrices.This work provides a new paradigm for accelerating attention computation in transformers to enable their application to longer contexts.</p>

                  <p>Cryptocurrency wallets, acting as fundamental infrastructure to the blockchain ecosystem, have seen significant user growth, particularly among browser-based wallets (i.e., browser extensions).However, this expansion accompanies security challenges, making these wallets prime targets for malicious activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite a substantial user base, there is not only a significant gap in comprehensive security analysis but also a pressing need for specialized tools that can aid developers in reducing vulnerabilities during the development process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To fill the void, we present a comprehensive security analysis of browser-based wallets in this paper, along with the development of an automated tool designed for this purpose.We first compile a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities resident in cryptocurrency wallets by harvesting historical security reports.Based on this, we design WALLETRADAR, an automated detection framework that can accurately identify security issues based on static and dynamic analysis.Evaluation of 96 popular browser-based wallets shows WALLETRADAR's effectiveness, by successfully automating the detection process in 90% of these wallets with high precision.This evaluation has led to the discovery of 116 security vulnerabilities corresponding to 70 wallets.By the time of this paper, we have received confirmations of 10 vulnerabilities from 8 wallet developers, with over $2,000 bug bounties.Further, we observed that 12 wallet developers have silently fixed 16 vulnerabilities after our disclosure.WALLETRADAR can effectively automate the identification of security risks in cryptocurrency wallets, thereby enhancing software development quality and safety in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have proven to be effective for software vulnerability detection, with a potential for substantial productivity enhancements for detecting vulnerabilities.Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring the more complex inter-procedural vulnerability detection scenarios in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions within repositories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>In addition, the widely-used benchmark datasets generally contain only intra-procedural vulnerabilities, leaving the assessment of inter-procedural vulnerability detection capabilities unexplored.   To mitigate the issues, we propose a repository-level evaluation system, named \textbf{VulEval}, aiming at evaluating the detection performance of inter- and intra-procedural vulnerabilities simultaneously.Specifically, VulEval consists of three interconnected evaluation tasks: \textbf{(1) Function-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting intra-procedural vulnerability given a code snippet; \textbf{(2) Vulnerability-Related Dependency Prediction}, aiming at retrieving the most relevant dependencies from call graphs for providing developers with explanations about the vulnerabilities; and \textbf{(3)Repository-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting inter-procedural vulnerabilities by combining with the dependencies identified in the second task.VulEval also consists of a large-scale dataset, with a total of 4,196 CVE entries, 232,239 functions, and corresponding 4,699 repository-level source code in C/C++ programming languages.Our analysis highlights the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>
