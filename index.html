                  <p>Despite recent advances in semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for terrestrial and aerial applications, underwater semantic SLAM remains an open and largely unaddressed research problem due to the unique sensing modalities and the object classes found underwater.This paper presents an object-based semantic SLAM method for underwater environments that can identify, localize, classify, and map a wide variety of marine objects without a priori knowledge of the object classes present in the scene.The method performs unsupervised object segmentation and object-level feature aggregation, and then uses opti-acoustic sensor fusion for object localization.Probabilistic data association is used to determine observation to landmark correspondences.Given such correspondences, the method then jointly optimizes landmark and vehicle position estimates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indoor and outdoor underwater datasets with a wide variety of objects and challenging acoustic and lighting conditions are collected for evaluation and made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Quantitative and qualitative results show the proposed method achieves reduced trajectory error compared to baseline methods, and is able to obtain comparable map accuracy to a baseline closed-set method that requires hand-labeled data of all objects in the scene.</p>

                  <p>Robotic Assisted Feeding (RAF) addresses the fundamental need for individuals with mobility impairments to regain autonomy in feeding themselves.The goal of RAF is to use a robot arm to acquire and transfer food to individuals from the table.Existing RAF methods primarily focus on solid foods, leaving a gap in manipulation strategies for semi-solid and deformable foods.This study introduces Long-horizon Visual Action (LAVA) based food acquisition of liquid, semisolid, and deformable foods.Long-horizon refers to the goal of "clearing the bowl" by sequentially acquiring the food from the bowl.LAVA employs a hierarchical policy for long-horizon food acquisition tasks.The framework uses high-level policy to determine primitives by leveraging ScoopNet.At the mid-level, LAVA finds parameters for primitives using vision.To carry out sequential plans in the real world, LAVA delegates action execution which is driven by Low-level policy that uses parameters received from mid-level policy and behavior cloning ensuring precise trajectory execution.We validate our approach on complex real-world acquisition trials involving granular, liquid, semisolid, and deformable food types along with fruit chunks and soup acquisition.Across 46 bowls, LAVA acquires much more efficiently than baselines with a success rate of 89 +/- 4% and generalizes across realistic plate variations such as different positions, varieties, and amount of food in the bowl.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, videos, and supplementary materials can be found on our website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset.We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Large-scale text-to-video models have shown remarkable abilities, but their direct application in video editing remains challenging due to limited available datasets.Current video editing methods commonly require per-video fine-tuning of diffusion models or specific inversion optimization to ensure high-fidelity edits.In this paper, we introduce EffiVED, an efficient diffusion-based model that directly supports instruction-guided video editing.To achieve this, we present two efficient workflows to gather video editing pairs, utilizing augmentation and fundamental vision-language techniques.These workflows transform vast image editing datasets and open-world videos into a high-quality dataset for training EffiVED.Experimental results reveal that EffiVED not only generates high-quality editing videos but also executes rapidly.Finally, we demonstrate that our data collection method significantly improves editing performance and can potentially tackle the scarcity of video editing data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets will be made publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.918</span></span></p>

                  <p>Typical LiDAR-based 3D object detection models are trained in a supervised manner with real-world data collection, which is often imbalanced over classes (or long-tailed).To deal with it, augmenting minority-class examples by sampling ground truth (GT) LiDAR points from a database and pasting them into a scene of interest is often used, but challenges still remain: inflexibility in locating GT samples and limited sample diversity.In this work, we propose to leverage pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated (at a low cost) from videos capturing a surround view of miniatures or real-world objects of minor classes.Our method, called Pseudo Ground Truth Augmentation (PGT-Aug), consists of three main steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity estimation and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information.We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reconstructing photo-realistic drivable human avatars from multi-view image sequences has been a popular and challenging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics.While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are time-consuming.Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the human body, enabling faster training and rendering.However, they undermine the importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with coarse mesh guidance.This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and tends to produce blurry textures.Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space Gaussian textures.We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to extract features.Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian rendering and significantly enhancing rendering quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect and process a new dataset of human motion, which includes multi-view images, scanned models, parametric model registration, and corresponding texture maps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art synthesis of novel view and novel pose.The code and data will be made available on the homepage https://alex-jyj.github.io/UV-Gaussians/ once the paper is accepted.</p>

                  <p>The study of music-generated dance is a novel and challenging Image generation task.It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then generate natural dance movements for the subsequent music.Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects.This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music.In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module.First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance.Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation.Finally, we conducted experiments on the dataset AIST++, and the results show that our approach achieves better and more robust performance in generating accurate, high-quality dance movements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be available from https://github.com/MarasyZZ/QEAN and https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span></p>

                  <p>To thoroughly assess the mathematical reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we need to carefully curate evaluation datasets covering diverse mathematical concepts and mathematical problems at different difficulty levels.In pursuit of this objective, we propose FineMath in this paper, a fine-grained mathematical evaluation benchmark dataset for assessing Chinese LLMs.FineMath is created to cover the major key mathematical concepts taught in elementary school math, which are further divided into 17 categories of math word problems, enabling in-depth analysis of mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs.All the 17 categories of math word problems are manually annotated with their difficulty levels according to the number of reasoning steps required to solve these problems.We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs on FineMath and find that there is still considerable room for improvements in terms of mathematical reasoning capability of Chinese LLMs.We also carry out an in-depth analysis on the evaluation process and methods that have been overlooked previously.These two factors significantly influence the model results and our understanding of their mathematical reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset will be publicly available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.97</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough results, opening countless new possibilities for many practical applications.However, LLMs lack elementary safety features that are established norms in other areas of computer science, such as the separation between instructions and data, causing them to malfunction or rendering them vulnerable to manipulation and interference by third parties e.g., via indirect prompt/command injection.Even worse, so far, there is not even an established definition of what precisely such a separation would mean and how its violation could be tested.In this work, we aim to close this gap.We introduce a formal measure to quantify the phenomenon of instruction-data separation as well as an empirical variant of the measure that can be computed from a model`s black-box outputs.We also introduce a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), which allows estimating the measure, and we report results on several state-of-the-art open-source and closed LLMs.Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs fail to achieve a high amount of separation, according to our measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment.In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations.The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions.Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background.However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task.Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes.We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models.This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns.Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise.OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes.They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem.Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning.In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions.The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise.The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss.To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, segmentation algorithms require dense annotations for training, demanding significant annotation efforts, particularly within the 3D medical imaging field.Scribble-supervised learning emerges as a possible solution to this challenge, promising a reduction in annotation efforts when creating large-scale datasets.Recently, a plethora of methods for optimized learning from scribbles have been proposed, but have so far failed to position scribble annotation as a beneficial alternative.We relate this shortcoming to two major issues: 1) the complex nature of many methods which deeply ties them to the underlying segmentation model, thus preventing a migration to more powerful state-of-the-art models as the field progresses and 2) the lack of a systematic evaluation to validate consistent performance across the broader medical domain, resulting in a lack of trust when applying these methods to new segmentation problems.To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive scribble supervision benchmark consisting of seven datasets covering a diverse set of anatomies and pathologies imaged with varying modalities.We furthermore propose the systematic use of partial losses, i.e. losses that are only computed on annotated voxels.Contrary to most existing methods, these losses can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art segmentation methods, enabling them to learn from scribble annotations while preserving their original loss formulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation using nnU-Net reveals that while most existing methods suffer from a lack of generalization, the proposed approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Thanks to its simplicity, our approach presents an embarrassingly simple yet effective solution to the challenges of scribble supervision.Source code as well as our extensive scribble benchmarking suite will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Released Large Language Models (LLMs) are often paired with a claimed knowledge cutoff date, or the dates at which training data was gathered.Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to date information.However, this statement only scratches the surface: do all resources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date?Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoff dates?In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff.This is distinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately to sub-resources and topics.We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing across versions of the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often differ from reported cutoffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets.Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates.Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information from these models.</p>

                  <p>Estimating human and camera trajectories with accurate scale in the world coordinate system from a monocular video is a highly desirable yet challenging and ill-posed problem.In this study, we aim to recover expressive parametric human models (i.e., SMPL-X) and corresponding camera poses jointly, by leveraging the synergy between three critical players: the world, the human, and the camera.Our approach is founded on two key observations.Firstly, camera-frame SMPL-X estimation methods readily recover absolute human depth.Secondly, human motions inherently provide absolute spatial cues.By integrating these insights, we introduce a novel framework, referred to as WHAC, to facilitate world-grounded expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) alongside camera pose estimation, without relying on traditional optimization techniques.Additionally, we present a new synthetic dataset, WHAC-A-Mole, which includes accurately annotated humans and cameras, and features diverse interactive human motions as well as realistic camera trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on both standard and newly established benchmarks highlight the superiority and efficacy of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We will make the code and dataset publicly available.</p>

                  <p>While polyhedral compilers have shown success in implementing advanced code transformations, they still have challenges in selecting the most profitable transformations that lead to the best speedups.This has motivated the use of machine learning to build cost models to guide the search for polyhedral optimizations.State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers have demonstrated a viable proof-of-concept of this approach.While such a proof-of-concept has shown promise, it still has significant limitations.State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers that use a deep-learning cost model only support a small subset of affine transformations, limiting their ability to apply complex code transformations.They also only support simple programs that have a single loop nest and a rectangular iteration domain, limiting their applicability to many programs.These limitations significantly impact the generality of such compilers and autoschedulers and put into question the whole approach.In this paper, we introduce LOOPer, the first polyhedral autoscheduler that uses a deep-learning based cost model and covers a large set of affine transformations and programs.It supports the exploration of a large set of affine transformations, allowing the application of complex sequences of polyhedral transformations.It also supports the optimization of programs with multiple loop nests and with rectangular and non-rectangular iteration domains, allowing the optimization of an extensive set of programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement and evaluate LOOPer and show that it achieves speedups over the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the Polybench benchmark, LOOPer achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1.59x over Tiramisu. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>LOOPer also achieves competitive speedups with a geometric mean speedup of 1.34x over Pluto, a state-of-the-art polyhedral compiler that does not use a machine-learning based cost model.</p>

                  <p>Keypoint detection and tracking in traditional image frames are often compromised by image quality issues such as motion blur and extreme lighting conditions.Event cameras offer potential solutions to these challenges by virtue of their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range.However, they have limited performance in practical applications due to their inherent noise in event data.This paper advocates fusing the complementary information from image frames and event streams to achieve more robust keypoint detection and tracking.Specifically, we propose a novel keypoint detection network that fuses the textural and structural information from image frames with the high-temporal-resolution motion information from event streams, namely FE-DeTr.The network leverages a temporal response consistency for supervision, ensuring stable and efficient keypoint detection.Moreover, we use a spatio-temporal nearest-neighbor search strategy for robust keypoint tracking.Extensive experiments are conducted on a new dataset featuring both image frames and event data captured under extreme conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results confirm the superior performance of our method over both existing frame-based and event-based methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>While many multi-armed bandit algorithms assume that rewards for all arms are constant across rounds, this assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios.This paper considers the setting of recovering bandits (Pike-Burke & Grunewalder, 2019), where the reward depends on the number of rounds elapsed since the last time an arm was pulled.We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to this setting, named the State-Separate SARSA (SS-SARSA) algorithm, which treats rounds as states.The SS-SARSA algorithm achieves efficient learning by reducing the number of state combinations required for Q-learning/SARSA, which often suffers from combinatorial issues for large-scale RL problems.Additionally, it makes minimal assumptions about the reward structure and offers lower computational complexity.Furthermore, we prove asymptotic convergence to an optimal policy under mild assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm across various settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the domain of text-guided image generation and, more recently, in text-guided image editing.A commonly adopted strategy for editing real images involves inverting the diffusion process to obtain a noisy representation of the original image, which is then denoised to achieve the desired edits.However, current methods for diffusion inversion often struggle to produce edits that are both faithful to the specified text prompt and closely resemble the source image.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and adaptable diffusion inversion technique for real image editing, which is grounded in a theoretical analysis of the role of $\eta$ in the DDIM sampling equation for enhanced editability.By designing a universal diffusion inversion method with a time- and region-dependent $\eta$ function, we enable flexible control over the editing extent.Through a comprehensive series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, involving a comparison with a broad array of recent methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method not only sets a new benchmark in the field but also significantly outperforms existing strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/eta-inversion</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their coding capabilities.However, existing benchmarks predominantly focused on simplified or isolated aspects of programming, such as single-file code generation or repository issue debugging, falling short of measuring the full spectrum of challenges raised by real-world programming activities.To this end, we propose DevBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs across various stages of the software development lifecycle, including software design, environment setup, implementation, acceptance testing, and unit testing.DevBench features a wide range of programming languages and domains, high-quality data collection, and carefully designed and verified metrics for each task.Empirical studies show that current LLMs, including GPT-4-Turbo, fail to solve the challenges presented within DevBench.Analyses reveal that models struggle with understanding the complex structures in the repository, managing the compilation process, and grasping advanced programming concepts.Our findings offer actionable insights for the future development of LLMs toward real-world programming applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/open-compass/DevBench <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Achieving robust uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks represents an important requirement in many real-world applications of deep learning such as medical imaging where it is necessary to assess the reliability of a neural network's prediction.Bayesian neural networks are a promising approach for modeling uncertainties in deep neural networks.Unfortunately, generating samples from the posterior distribution of neural networks is a major challenge.One significant advance in that direction would be the incorporation of adaptive step sizes, similar to modern neural network optimizers, into Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling algorithms without significantly increasing computational demand.Over the past years, several papers have introduced sampling algorithms with claims that they achieve this property.However, do they indeed converge to the correct distribution?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we demonstrate that these methods can have a substantial bias in the distribution they sample, even in the limit of vanishing step sizes and at full batch size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) problem plays a crucial role across various domains, bridging theoretical exploration and practical applications in fields like bioinformatics and social network analysis.Despite its wide applicability, MCS is notoriously challenging and is classified as an NP-Complete (NPC) problem.This study introduces new heuristics aimed at mitigating these challenges through the reformulation of the MCS problem as the Maximum Clique and its complement, the Maximum Independent Set.Our first heuristic leverages the Motzkin-Straus theorem to reformulate the Maximum Clique Problem as a constrained optimization problem, continuing the work of Pelillo in Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism (1999) with replicator dynamics and introducing annealed imitation heuristics as in Dominant Sets and Hierarchical Clustering (Pavan and Pelillo, 2003) to improve chances of convergence to better local optima.The second technique applies heuristics drawn upon strategies for the Maximum Independent Set problem to efficiently reduce graph sizes as used by Akiwa and Iwata in 2014.This enables faster computation and, in many instances, yields near-optimal solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore we look at the implementation of both techniques in a single algorithm and find that it is a promising approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our techniques were tested on randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph pairs.Results indicate the potential for application and substantial impact on future research directions.</p>

                  <p>We propose GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit a 3D scene reconstructed by the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).   Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.   Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.   It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.   This is achieved by the two terms:   (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.   (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D correspondence, i.e., a pair of 3D points, is a fundamental concept in computer vision.A set of 3D correspondences, when equipped with compatibility edges, forms a correspondence graph.This graph is a critical component in several state-of-the-art 3D point cloud registration approaches, e.g., the one based on maximal cliques (MAC).However, its properties have not been well understood.So we present the first study that introduces graph signal processing into the domain of correspondence graph.We exploit the generalized degree signal on correspondence graph and pursue sampling strategies that preserve high-frequency components of this signal.To address time-consuming singular value decomposition in deterministic sampling, we resort to a stochastic approximate sampling strategy.As such, the core of our method is the stochastic spectral sampling of correspondence graph.As an application, we build a complete 3D registration algorithm termed as FastMAC, that reaches real-time speed while leading to little to none performance drop.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we validate that FastMAC works for both indoor and outdoor benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>For example, FastMAC can accelerate MAC by 80 times while maintaining high registration success rate on KITTI.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Forrest-110/FastMAC.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Code revert prediction, a specialized form of software defect detection, aims to forecast or predict the likelihood of code changes being reverted or rolled back in software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is very important in practice because by identifying code changes that are more prone to being reverted, developers and project managers can proactively take measures to prevent issues, improve code quality, and optimize development processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>However, compared to code defect detection, code revert prediction has been rarely studied in previous research.Additionally, many previous methods for code defect detection relied on independent features but ignored relationships between code scripts.Moreover, new challenges are introduced due to constraints in an industry setting such as company regulation, limited features and large-scale codebase.To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a systematic empirical study for code revert prediction that integrates the code import graph with code features.Different strategies to address anomalies and data imbalance have been implemented including graph neural networks with imbalance classification and anomaly detection.We conduct the experiments on real-world code commit data within J.P. Morgan Chase which is extremely imbalanced in order to make a comprehensive comparison of these different approaches for the code revert prediction problem.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI models are increasingly powering software applications, offering the capability to produce expressive content across varied contexts.However, unlike previous iterations of human-AI design, the emerging design process for generative capabilities primarily hinges on prompt engineering strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given this fundamental shift in approach, our work aims to understand how collaborative software teams set up and apply design guidelines and values, iteratively prototype prompts, and evaluate prompts to achieve desired outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We conducted design studies with 39 industry professionals, including designers, software engineers, and product managers.Our findings reveal a content-centric prototyping approach in which teams begin with the content they want to generate, then identify specific attributes, constraints, and values, and explore methods to give users the ability to influence and interact with those attributes.Based on associated challenges, such as the lack of model interpretability and overfitting the design to examples, we outline considerations for generative AI prototyping.</p>
