                  <p>Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs.They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur.However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks.While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps.This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span></p>

                  <p>Long document question answering (DocQA) aims to answer questions from long documents over 10k words.They usually contain content structures such as sections, sub-sections, and paragraph demarcations.However, the indexing methods of long documents remain under-explored, while existing systems generally employ fixed-length chunking.As they do not consider content structures, the resultant chunks can exclude vital information or include irrelevant content.Motivated by this, we propose the Multi-view Content-aware indexing (MC-indexing) for more effective long DocQA via (i) segment structured document into content chunks, and (ii) represent each content chunk in raw-text, keywords, and summary views.We highlight that MC-indexing requires neither training nor fine-tuning.Having plug-and-play capability, it can be seamlessly integrated with any retrievers to boost their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we propose a long DocQA dataset that includes not only question-answer pair, but also document structure and answer scope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>When compared to state-of-art chunking schemes, MC-indexing has significantly increased the recall by 42.8%, 30.0%, 23.9%, and 16.3% via top k= 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 respectively.These improved scores are the average of 8 widely used retrievers (2 sparse and 6 dense) via extensive experiments.</p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents the UniMER dataset to provide the first study on Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) towards complex real-world scenarios.The UniMER dataset consists of a large-scale training set UniMER-1M offering an unprecedented scale and diversity with one million training instances and a meticulously designed test set UniMER-Test that reflects a diverse range of formula distributions prevalent in real-world scenarios.Therefore, the UniMER dataset enables the training of a robust and high-accuracy MER model and comprehensive evaluation of model performance.Moreover, we introduce the Universal Mathematical Expression Recognition Network (UniMERNet), an innovative framework designed to enhance MER in practical scenarios.UniMERNet incorporates a Length-Aware Module to process formulas of varied lengths efficiently, thereby enabling the model to handle complex mathematical expressions with greater accuracy.In addition, UniMERNet employs our UniMER-1M data and image augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness under different noise conditions.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMERNet outperforms existing MER models, setting a new benchmark in various scenarios and ensuring superior recognition quality in real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/opendatalab/UniMERNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern.With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed?To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages.RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language.We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario.We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages.As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language.However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work.This has limited progress in the field.This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem.Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign.Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation.Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens.Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network.Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.</p>

                  <p>Pansharpening is a significant image fusion technique that merges the spatial content and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images to generate high-resolution multispectral images.Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA).In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition.Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion.Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches.The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method.It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The code will be made open source after possible acceptance.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality.However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects.For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves.This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts.We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts.We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine learning is now used in many applications thanks to its ability to predict, generate, or discover patterns from large quantities of data.However, the process of collecting and transforming data for practical use is intricate.Even in today's digital era, where substantial data is generated daily, it is uncommon for it to be readily usable; most often, it necessitates meticulous manual data preparation.The haste in developing new models can frequently result in various shortcomings, potentially posing risks when deployed in real-world scenarios (eg social discrimination, critical failures), leading to the failure or substantial escalation of costs in AI-based projects.This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of established methodological tools, enriched by our practical experience, in the development of datasets for machine learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Initially, we develop the tasks involved in dataset development and offer insights into their effective management (including requirements, design, implementation, evaluation, distribution, and maintenance). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Then, we provide more details about the implementation process which includes data collection, transformation, and quality evaluation.Finally, we address practical considerations regarding dataset distribution and maintenance.</p>

                  <p>Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass.Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction.To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering.We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering.We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices.Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures.This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality.Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Wikipedia is the largest web repository of free knowledge.Volunteer editors devote time and effort to creating and expanding articles in more than 300 language editions.As content quality varies from article to article, editors also spend substantial time rating articles with specific criteria.However, keeping these assessments complete and up-to-date is largely impossible given the ever-changing nature of Wikipedia.To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel computational framework for modeling the quality of Wikipedia articles.   State-of-the-art approaches to model Wikipedia article quality have leveraged machine learning techniques with language-specific features.In contrast, our framework is based on language-agnostic structural features extracted from the articles, a set of universal weights, and a language version-specific normalization criterion.Therefore, we ensure that all language editions of Wikipedia can benefit from our framework, even those that do not have their own quality assessment scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this framework, we have built datasets with the feature values and quality scores of all revisions of all articles in the existing language versions of Wikipedia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>We provide a descriptive analysis of these resources and a benchmark of our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we discuss possible downstream tasks to be addressed with these datasets, which are released for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a category of Federated Learning in which models are trained collaboratively among parties with vertically partitioned data.Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner.Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels.These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL.In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that by applying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacks decreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of the whole VFL almost unaltered. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem.However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems.Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems.As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers.One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner.We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them.When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors.This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors.We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Stance detection has been widely studied as the task of determining if a social media post is positive, negative or neutral towards a specific issue, such as support towards vaccines.Research in stance detection has however often been limited to a single language and, where more than one language has been studied, research has focused on few-shot settings, overlooking the challenges of developing a zero-shot cross-lingual stance detection model.This paper makes the first such effort by introducing a novel approach to zero-shot cross-lingual stance detection, Multilingual Translation-Augmented BERT (MTAB), aiming to enhance the performance of a cross-lingual classifier in the absence of explicit training data for target languages.Our technique employs translation augmentation to improve zero-shot performance and pairs it with adversarial learning to further boost model efficacy.Through experiments on datasets labeled for stance towards vaccines in four languages English, German, French, Italian.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, showcasing improved results in comparison to a strong baseline model as well as ablated versions of our model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of model components, not least the translation-augmented data as well as the adversarial learning component, to the improved performance of the model.We have made our source code accessible on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models.There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why?In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems.Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a "negative gradient") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives.We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions.Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively.Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement.</p>

                  <p>Stable locomotion in precipitous environments is an essential capability of quadruped robots, demanding the ability to resist various external disturbances.However, recent learning-based policies only use basic domain randomization to improve the robustness of learned policies, which cannot guarantee that the robot has adequate disturbance resistance capabilities.In this paper, we propose to model the learning process as an adversarial interaction between the actor and a newly introduced disturber and ensure their optimization with $H_{\infty}$ constraint.In contrast to the actor that maximizes the discounted overall reward, the disturber is responsible for generating effective external forces and is optimized by maximizing the error between the task reward and its oracle, i.e., "cost" in each iteration.To keep joint optimization between the actor and the disturber stable, our $H_{\infty}$ constraint mandates the bound of ratio between the cost to the intensity of the external forces.Through reciprocal interaction throughout the training phase, the actor can acquire the capability to navigate increasingly complex physical disturbances.We verify the robustness of our approach on quadrupedal locomotion tasks with Unitree Aliengo robot, and also a more challenging task with Unitree A1 robot, where the quadruped is expected to perform locomotion merely on its hind legs as if it is a bipedal robot.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The simulated quantitative results show improvement against baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method and each design choice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>On the other hand, real-robot experiments qualitatively exhibit how robust the policy is when interfering with various disturbances on various terrains, including stairs, high platforms, slopes, and slippery terrains.All code, checkpoints, and real-world deployment guidance will be made public.</p>

                  <p>Stochastic learning to rank (LTR) is a recent branch in the LTR field that concerns the optimization of probabilistic ranking models.Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models.For example, they can increase the diversity of displayed documents, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balance exploitation and exploration through randomization.A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks).This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.   In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs.Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thus, through the contribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfully introduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques for the estimation of treatment effects.Most of the best-performing methods rely on representation learning strategies that encourage shared behavior among potential outcomes to increase the precision of treatment effect estimates.In this paper we discuss and classify these models in terms of their algorithmic inductive biases and present a new model, NN-CGC, that considers additional information from the causal graph.NN-CGC tackles bias resulting from spurious variable interactions by implementing novel constraints on models, and it can be integrated with other representation learning methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test the effectiveness of our method using three different base models on common benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Our results indicate that our model constraints lead to significant improvements, achieving new state-of-the-art results in treatment effects estimation.We also show that our method is robust to imperfect causal graphs and that using partial causal information is preferable to ignoring it.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection and localization in images is a growing field in computer vision.In this area, a seemingly understudied problem is anomaly clustering, i.e., identifying and grouping different types of anomalies in a fully unsupervised manner.In this work, we propose a novel method for clustering anomalies in largely stationary images (textures) in a blind setting.That is, the input consists of normal and anomalous images without distinction and without labels.What contributes to the difficulty of the task is that anomalous regions are often small and may present only subtle changes in appearance, which can be easily overshadowed by the genuine variance in the texture.Moreover, each anomaly type may have a complex appearance distribution.We introduce a novel scheme for solving this task using a combination of blind anomaly localization and contrastive learning.By identifying the anomalous regions with high fidelity, we can restrict our focus to those regions of interest; then, contrastive learning is employed to increase the separability of different anomaly types and reduce the intra-class variation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that the proposed solution yields significantly better results compared to prior work, setting a new state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Project page: https://reality.tf.fau.de/pub/ardelean2024blind.html.</p>

                  <p>The objective of this paper is motion segmentation -- discovering and segmenting the moving objects in a video.This is a much studied area with numerous careful,and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemes including: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets, object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more.Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task.We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects.In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input.In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentations that maintain object identity.Again, this simple model outperforms previous methods on multiple video object segmentation benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Stochastic video prediction enables the consideration of uncertainty in future motion, thereby providing a better reflection of the dynamic nature of the environment.Stochastic video prediction methods based on image auto-regressive recurrent models need to feed their predictions back into the latent space.Conversely, the state-space models, which decouple frame synthesis and temporal prediction, proves to be more efficient.However, inferring long-term temporal information about motion and generalizing to dynamic scenarios under non-stationary assumptions remains an unresolved challenge.In this paper, we propose a state-space decomposition stochastic video prediction model that decomposes the overall video frame generation into deterministic appearance prediction and stochastic motion prediction.Through adaptive decomposition, the model's generalization capability to dynamic scenarios is enhanced.In the context of motion prediction, obtaining a prior on the long-term trend of future motion is crucial.Thus, in the stochastic motion prediction branch, we infer the long-term motion trend from conditional frames to guide the generation of future frames that exhibit high consistency with the conditional frames.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on multiple datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/</p>

                  <p>We introduce a new area of study in the field of educational Natural Language Processing: Automated Long Answer Grading (ALAG).Distinguishing itself from Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and Automated Essay Grading (AEG), ALAG presents unique challenges due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of fact-based long answers.To study ALAG, we introduce RiceChem, a dataset derived from a college chemistry course, featuring real student responses to long-answer questions with an average word count notably higher than typical ASAG datasets.We propose a novel approach to ALAG by formulating it as a rubric entailment problem, employing natural language inference models to verify whether each criterion, represented by a rubric item, is addressed in the student's response.This formulation enables the effective use of MNLI for transfer learning, significantly improving the performance of models on the RiceChem dataset.We demonstrate the importance of rubric-based formulation in ALAG, showcasing its superiority over traditional score-based approaches in capturing the nuances of student responses.We also investigate the performance of models in cold start scenarios, providing valuable insights into the practical deployment considerations in educational settings.Lastly, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) on RiceChem and compare their results to GPT models, highlighting the increased complexity of ALAG compared to ASAG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite leveraging the benefits of a rubric-based approach and transfer learning from MNLI, the lower performance of LLMs on RiceChem underscores the significant difficulty posed by the ALAG task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>With this work, we offer a fresh perspective on grading long, fact-based answers and introduce a new dataset to stimulate further research in this important area.Code: \url{https://github.com/luffycodes/Automated-Long-Answer-Grading}.</p>

                  <p>As software-intensive systems face growing pressure to comply with laws and regulations, providing automated support for compliance analysis has become paramount.Despite advances in the Requirements Engineering (RE) community on legal compliance analysis, important obstacles remain in developing accurate and generalizable compliance automation solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper highlights some observed limitations of current approaches and examines how adopting new automation strategies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these shortcomings and open up fresh opportunities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Specifically, we argue that the examination of (textual) legal artifacts should, first, employ a broader context than sentences, which have widely been used as the units of analysis in past research.Second, the mode of analysis with legal artifacts needs to shift from classification and information extraction to more end-to-end strategies that are not only accurate but also capable of providing explanation and justification.We present a compliance analysis approach designed to address these limitations.We further outline our evaluation plan for the approach and provide preliminary evaluation results based on data processing agreements (DPAs) that must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Our initial findings suggest that our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements and, at the same time, provides justification for compliance decisions.</p>

                  <p>Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models.There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning.Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient.This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a "negative gradient") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives.We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions.Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including automated program repair (APR).In this study, we take a deep dive into automated bug fixing utilizing LLMs.In contrast to many deep learning-based APR methods that assume known bug locations, rely on line-level localization tools, or address bug prediction and fixing in one step, our approach uniquely employs LLMs to predict bug location at the token level and subsequently utilizes them for bug fixing.This methodological separation of bug localization and fixing using different LLMs enables effective integration of diverse contextual information and improved incorporation of inductive biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Toggle: Token-Granulated Bug Localization and Repair, a comprehensive program repair framework that integrates a bug localization model, an adjustment unit, and a bug-fixing model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Toggle takes a buggy function as input and generates a complete corrected function.We investigate various styles of prompting to the bug fixing model to identify the most effective prompts that better utilize the inductive bias and significantly outperform others.Toggle achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CodeXGLUE code refinement benchmark, and exhibits better and comparable performance on several other widely-used APR datasets, including Defects4J.</p>
