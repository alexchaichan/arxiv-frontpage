                  <p>Trigger warnings are labels that preface documents with sensitive content if this content could be perceived as harmful by certain groups of readers.Since warnings about a document intuitively need to be shown before reading it, authors usually assign trigger warnings at the document level.What parts of their writing prompted them to assign a warning, however, remains unclear.We investigate for the first time the feasibility of identifying the triggering passages of a document, both manually and computationally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We create a dataset of 4,135 English passages, each annotated with one of eight common trigger warnings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.914</span></span>In a large-scale evaluation, we then systematically evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and few-shot classifiers, and their generalizability.We find that trigger annotation belongs to the group of subjective annotation tasks in NLP, and that automatic trigger classification remains challenging but feasible.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass.Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction.To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering.We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering.We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices.Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures.This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality.Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Wikipedia is the largest web repository of free knowledge.Volunteer editors devote time and effort to creating and expanding articles in more than 300 language editions.As content quality varies from article to article, editors also spend substantial time rating articles with specific criteria.However, keeping these assessments complete and up-to-date is largely impossible given the ever-changing nature of Wikipedia.To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel computational framework for modeling the quality of Wikipedia articles.   State-of-the-art approaches to model Wikipedia article quality have leveraged machine learning techniques with language-specific features.In contrast, our framework is based on language-agnostic structural features extracted from the articles, a set of universal weights, and a language version-specific normalization criterion.Therefore, we ensure that all language editions of Wikipedia can benefit from our framework, even those that do not have their own quality assessment scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this framework, we have built datasets with the feature values and quality scores of all revisions of all articles in the existing language versions of Wikipedia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>We provide a descriptive analysis of these resources and a benchmark of our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we discuss possible downstream tasks to be addressed with these datasets, which are released for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress in image denoising, it is still challenging to restore fine-scale details while removing noise, especially in extremely low-light environments.Leveraging near-infrared (NIR) images to assist visible RGB image denoising shows the potential to address this issue, becoming a promising technology.Nonetheless, existing works still struggle with taking advantage of NIR information effectively for real-world image denoising, due to the content inconsistency between NIR-RGB images and the scarcity of real-world paired datasets.To alleviate the problem, we propose an efficient Selective Fusion Module (SFM), which can be plug-and-played into the advanced denoising networks to merge the deep NIR-RGB features.Specifically, we sequentially perform the global and local modulation for NIR and RGB features, and then integrate the two modulated features.Furthermore, we present a Real-world NIR-Assisted Image Denoising (Real-NAID) dataset, which covers diverse scenarios as well as various noise levels.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and our real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents that accomplish complex computer tasks with minimal human interventions have the potential to transform human-computer interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility and productivity.However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability.To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications.Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants.While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, environment, baseline models, and data are publicly available at https://os-world.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the field of visual affordance learning, previous methods mainly used abundant images or videos that delineate human behavior patterns to identify action possibility regions for object manipulation, with a variety of applications in robotic tasks.However, they encounter a main challenge of action ambiguity, illustrated by the vagueness like whether to beat or carry a drum, and the complexities involved in processing intricate scenes.Moreover, it is important for human intervention to rectify robot errors in time.To address these issues, we introduce Self-Explainable Affordance learning (SEA) with embodied caption.This innovation enables robots to articulate their intentions and bridge the gap between explainable vision-language caption and visual affordance learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to a lack of appropriate dataset, we unveil a pioneering dataset and metrics tailored for this task, which integrates images, heatmaps, and embodied captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a novel model to effectively combine affordance grounding with self-explanation in a simple but efficient manner.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists.Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views.Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold.First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back).Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered.This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator.In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts.We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens.In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities.Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens).Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs.We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing.These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding.To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks.Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</p>

                  <p>We present a new self-supervised approach, SelfPose3d, for estimating 3d poses of multiple persons from multiple camera views.Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods, our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator.We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation.We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points, serving as 3d person root positions, and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views.We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation, map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints, and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner.Afterwards, we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels, we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Our experiments and analysis on three public benchmark datasets, including Panoptic, Shelf, and Campus, show the effectiveness of our approach, which is comparable to fully-supervised methods.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SelfPose3D}</p>

                  <p>The complexity of the alignment problem stems from the fact that existing methods are unstable.Researchers continuously invent various tricks to address this shortcoming.For instance, in the fundamental Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) technique of Language Model alignment, in addition to reward maximization, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the trainable policy and the SFT policy is minimized.This addition prevents the model from being overfitted to the Reward Model (RM) and generating texts that are out-of-domain for the RM.The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method reformulates the optimization task of RLHF and eliminates the Reward Model while tacitly maintaining the requirement for the policy to be close to the SFT policy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our paper, we argue that this implicit limitation in the DPO method leads to sub-optimal results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>We propose a new method called Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO), which updates the reference policy during training.With such a straightforward update, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TR-DPO against DPO on the Anthropic HH and TLDR datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that TR-DPO outperforms DPO by up to 19%, measured by automatic evaluation with GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The new alignment approach that we propose allows us to improve the quality of models across several parameters at once, such as coherence, correctness, level of detail, helpfulness, and harmlessness.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a new research direction for online Multi-Level Aggregation (MLA) with delays.In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$, and we have to serve a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices in an online manner.Each request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)$ and location $l(r)$ (a vertex).Once a request $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t > t(r)$. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, and the service cost of a service corresponds to the weight of the subtree that contains all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t >t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized.The current best algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$ (Azar and Touitou, FOCS'19), where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.   Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process.We present a deterministic online algorithm which achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices.This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that ``single-minded" or ``sample-average" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.</p>

                  <p>One of the notorious issues for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is poor sample efficiency.Compared to single agent RL, the sample efficiency for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more challenging because of its inherent partial observability, non-stationary training, and enormous strategy space.Although much effort has been devoted to developing new methods and enhancing sample efficiency, we look at the widely used episodic training mechanism.In each training step, tens of frames are collected, but only one gradient step is made.We argue that this episodic training could be a source of poor sample efficiency.To better exploit the data already collected, we propose to increase the frequency of the gradient updates per environment interaction (a.k.a. Replay Ratio or Update-To-Data ratio).To show its generality, we evaluate $3$ MARL methods on $6$ SMAC tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results validate that a higher replay ratio significantly improves the sample efficiency for MARL algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>The codes to reimplement the results presented in this paper are open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rr_for_MARL-0D83/.</p>

                  <p>Studies continually find that message-passing graph convolutional networks suffer from the over-smoothing issue.Basically, the issue of over-smoothing refers to the phenomenon that the learned embeddings for all nodes can become very similar to one another and therefore are uninformative after repeatedly applying message passing iterations.Intuitively, we can expect the generated embeddings become smooth asymptotically layerwisely, that is each layer of graph convolution generates a smoothed version of embeddings as compared to that generated by the previous layer.Based on this intuition, we propose RandAlign, a stochastic regularization method for graph convolutional networks.The idea of RandAlign is to randomly align the learned embedding for each node with that of the previous layer using randomly interpolation in each graph convolution layer.Through alignment, the smoothness of the generated embeddings is explicitly reduced.To better maintain the benefit yielded by the graph convolution, in the alignment step we introduce to first scale the embedding of the previous layer to the same norm as the generated embedding and then perform random interpolation for aligning the generated embedding.RandAlign is a parameter-free method and can be directly applied without introducing additional trainable weights or hyper-parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally evaluate RandAlign on different graph domain tasks on seven benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>The experimental results show that RandAlign is a general method that improves the generalization performance of various graph convolutional network models and also improves the numerical stability of optimization, advancing the state of the art performance for graph representation learning.</p>

                  <p>Referring image segmentation is a challenging task that involves generating pixel-wise segmentation masks based on natural language descriptions.Existing methods have relied mostly on visual features to generate the segmentation masks while treating text features as supporting components.This over-reliance on visual features can lead to suboptimal results, especially in complex scenarios where text prompts are ambiguous or context-dependent.To overcome these challenges, we present a novel framework VATEX to improve referring image segmentation by enhancing object and context understanding with Vision-Aware Text Feature.Our method involves using CLIP to derive a CLIP Prior that integrates an object-centric visual heatmap with text description, which can be used as the initial query in DETR-based architecture for the segmentation task.Furthermore, by observing that there are multiple ways to describe an instance in an image, we enforce feature similarity between text variations referring to the same visual input by two components: a novel Contextual Multimodal Decoder that turns text embeddings into vision-aware text features, and a Meaning Consistency Constraint to ensure further the coherent and consistent interpretation of language expressions with the context understanding obtained from the image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves a significant performance improvement on three benchmark datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Code is available at: https://nero1342.github.io/VATEX\_RIS.</p>

                  <p>$\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect.Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients.$\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831).LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2.Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2.Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements.We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis.$\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P<0.01).For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772.In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>$\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net achieved high performance in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</p>

                  <p>Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.Quantum processors and cloud services have been made world-wide increasingly available.Unfortunately, programs on existing quantum processors are often executed in series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor.Typically, one has to wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum program on public quantum cloud due to long queue time.In fact, as the scale grows, the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish, causing the waste of quantum resources.In this paper, to our best knowledge for the first time, the Quantum Program Scheduling Problem (QPSP) is formulated and introduced to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources.Specifically, a quantum program scheduling method concerning the circuit width, number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum programs is proposed to reduce the execution latency.We conduct extensive experiments on a simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek) superconducting quantum processor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results show the effectiveness in both QPU time and turnaround time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions.In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation.To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second.We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation.This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition.Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios.Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains.However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost.More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm.In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding.Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality.This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors.Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

                  <p>Matching cost aggregation plays a fundamental role in learning-based multi-view stereo networks.However, directly aggregating adjacent costs can lead to suboptimal results due to local geometric inconsistency.Related methods either seek selective aggregation or improve aggregated depth in the 2D space, both are unable to handle geometric inconsistency in the cost volume effectively.In this paper, we propose GoMVS to aggregate geometrically consistent costs, yielding better utilization of adjacent geometries.More specifically, we correspond and propagate adjacent costs to the reference pixel by leveraging the local geometric smoothness in conjunction with surface normals.We achieve this by the geometric consistent propagation (GCP) module.It computes the correspondence from the adjacent depth hypothesis space to the reference depth space using surface normals, then uses the correspondence to propagate adjacent costs to the reference geometry, followed by a convolution for aggregation.Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temple, and ETH3D datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our method ranks 1st on the Tanks & Temple Advanced benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>In solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have exhibited notable effectiveness compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).This paper presents clear empirical evidence through spectral analysis to elucidate the superiority of FNO over CNNs: FNO is significantly more capable of learning low-frequencies.This empirical evidence also unveils FNO's distinct low-frequency bias, which limits FNO's effectiveness in learning high-frequency information from PDE data.To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecBoost, an ensemble learning framework that employs multiple FNOs to better capture high-frequency information.Specifically, a secondary FNO is utilized to learn the overlooked high-frequency information from the prediction residual of the initial FNO.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that SpecBoost noticeably enhances FNO's prediction accuracy on diverse PDE applications, achieving an up to 71% improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents OpenAirLink(OAL), an open-source channel emulator for reproducible testing of wireless scenarios.OAL is implemented on off-the-shelf software-defined radios (SDR) and presents a smaller-scale alternative to expensive commercially available channel emulators.Path loss and propagation delay are the fundamental aspects of emulating a wireless channel.OAL provides a simple method to change these aspects in real-time.The emulator is implemented using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.The FIR filter is written in Verilog and flashed on the SDRs Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most processing transpires on the FPGA, so OAL does not require high-performance computing hardware and SDRs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We validate the performance of OAL and demonstrate the utility of such a channel emulation tool using two examples.We believe that open-source channel emulators such as OAL can make reproducible wireless experiments accessible to many researchers in the scientific community.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

                  <p>Text classification systems have continuously improved in performance over the years.However, nearly all current SOTA classifiers have a similar shortcoming, they process text in a horizontal manner.Vertically written words will not be recognized by a classifier.In contrast, humans are easily able to recognize and read words written both horizontally and vertically.Hence, a human adversary could write problematic words vertically and the meaning would still be preserved to other humans.We simulate such an attack, VertAttack.VertAttack identifies which words a classifier is reliant on and then rewrites those words vertically.We find that VertAttack is able to greatly drop the accuracy of 4 different transformer models on 5 datasets.For example, on the SST2 dataset, VertAttack is able to drop RoBERTa's accuracy from 94 to 13%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, since VertAttack does not replace the word, meaning is easily preserved. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We verify this via a human study and find that crowdworkers are able to correctly label 77% perturbed texts perturbed, compared to 81% of the original texts.We believe VertAttack offers a look into how humans might circumvent classifiers in the future and thus inspire a look into more robust algorithms.</p>
