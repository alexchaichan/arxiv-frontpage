                  <p>Scenario data play a vital role in autonomous driving related researches, and it is essential to obtain refined descriptions and labels to extract and index scenarios with different types of interactions.However, existing methods cannot cope well with the problem of scenario classification and comparison with vehicle interactions as the core.In this paper, we propose a framework for interaction-based refined scenario classification and labeling.Based on the summarized basic types of vehicle interactions, we slice scenario data stream into a series of scenario segments via spatiotemporal scenario evolution tree.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scenario segment statistics of many published scenario datasets are further analyzed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>We also propose the scenario metric Graph-DTW based on Graph Computation Tree and Dynamic Time Warping to conduct refined scenario comparison and labeling.The extreme interactive scenarios and corner cases can be efficiently filtered and extracted.Moreover, testing examples on trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of scenario labeling and the proposed metric.The overall framework can provide solid support for the usage and indexing of scenario data.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena.This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement.In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 6,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, ICPSR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>This study offers four important insights.First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public).Second, the combination of datasets with atypically combined topics has the opposite effect -- the use of such data is associated with fewer citations.Third, younger and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research at a higher frequency than their older and more experienced counterparts.Lastly, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent.This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an under-utilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific and broader impact of scientific discoveries.</p>

                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a follow-up study to OpenAI's recent superalignment work on Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG).Superalignment focuses on ensuring that high-level AI systems remain consistent with human values and intentions when dealing with complex, high-risk tasks.The W2SG framework has opened new possibilities for empirical research in this evolving field.Our study simulates two phases of superalignment under the W2SG framework: the development of general superhuman models and the progression towards superintelligence.In the first phase, based on human supervision, the quality of weak supervision is enhanced through a combination of scalable oversight and ensemble learning, reducing the capability gap between weak teachers and strong students.In the second phase, an automatic alignment evaluator is employed as the weak supervisor.By recursively updating this auto aligner, the capabilities of the weak teacher models are synchronously enhanced, achieving weak-to-strong supervision over stronger student models.We also provide an initial validation of the proposed approach for the first phase.Using the SciQ task as example, we explore ensemble learning for weak teacher models through bagging and boosting.Scalable oversight is explored through two auxiliary settings: human-AI interaction and AI-AI debate.Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of improved weak supervision on enhancing weak-to-strong generalization based on in-context learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/W2SG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>As NLP models become increasingly capable of understanding documents in terms of coherent entities rather than strings, obtaining the most salient entities for each document is not only an important end task in itself but also vital for Information Retrieval (IR) and other downstream applications such as controllable summarization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present and evaluate GUMsley, the first entity salience dataset covering all named and non-named salient entities for 12 genres of English text, aligned with entity types, Wikification links and full coreference resolution annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>We promote a strict definition of salience using human summaries and demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement for salience based on whether a source entity is mentioned in the summary.Our evaluation shows poor performance by pre-trained SOTA summarization models and zero-shot LLM prompting in capturing salient entities in generated summaries.We also show that predicting or providing salient entities to several model architectures enhances performance and helps derive higher-quality summaries by alleviating the entity hallucination problem in existing abstractive summarization.</p>

                  <p>In the context of rapid advancements in industrial automation, vision-based robotic grasping plays an increasingly crucial role.In order to enhance visual recognition accuracy, the utilization of large-scale datasets is imperative for training models to acquire implicit knowledge related to the handling of various objects.Creating datasets from scratch is a time and labor-intensive process.Moreover, existing datasets often contain errors due to automated annotations aimed at expediency, making the improvement of these datasets a substantial research challenge.Consequently, several issues have been identified in the annotation of grasp bounding boxes within the popular Jacquard Grasp.We propose utilizing a Human-In-The-Loop(HIL) method to enhance dataset quality.This approach relies on backbone deep learning networks to predict object positions and orientations for robotic grasping.Predictions with Intersection over Union (IOU) values below 0.2 undergo an assessment by human operators.After their evaluation, the data is categorized into False Negatives(FN) and True Negatives(TN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FN are then subcategorized into either missing annotations or catastrophic labeling errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Images lacking labels are augmented with valid grasp bounding box information, whereas images afflicted by catastrophic labeling errors are completely removed.The open-source tool Labelbee was employed for 53,026 iterations of HIL dataset enhancement, leading to the removal of 2,884 images and the incorporation of ground truth information for 30,292 images.The enhanced dataset, named the Jacquard V2 Grasping Dataset, served as the training data for a range of neural networks.</p>

                  <p>Generating sufficient labeled data is a significant hurdle in the efficient execution of deep learning projects, especially in uncharted territories of image segmentation where labeling demands extensive time, unlike classification tasks.Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data.Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset.Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques.For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.The full code is available at: https://github.com/MichaelVorndran/InconsistencyMasks</p>

                  <p>Centrality measures, quantifying the importance of vertices or edges, play a fundamental role in network analysis.To date, triggered by some positive approximability results, a large body of work has been devoted to studying centrality maximization, where the goal is to maximize the centrality score of a target vertex by manipulating the structure of a given network.On the other hand, due to the lack of such results, only very little attention has been paid to centrality minimization, despite its practical usefulness.   In this study, we introduce a novel optimization model for local centrality minimization, where the manipulation is allowed only around the target vertex.We prove the NP-hardness of our model and that the most intuitive greedy algorithm has a quite limited performance in terms of approximation ratio.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we design two effective approximation algorithms: The first algorithm is a highly-scalable algorithm that has an approximation ratio unachievable by the greedy algorithm, while the second algorithm is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that solves a continuous relaxation based on the Lov\'asz extension, using a projected subgradient method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first polynomial-time algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for centrality minimization.Experiments using a variety of real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms: Our first algorithm is applicable to million-scale graphs and obtains much better solutions than those of scalable baselines, while our second algorithm is rather strong against adversarial instances.</p>

The $\boldsymbol{y}$ indeterminates are considered as parameters and we assume that when specialising them generically, the set of common complex solutions, to the obtained equations, is finite.We consider the problem of real root classification for such parameter-dependent problems, i.e. identifying the possible number of real solutions depending on the values of the parameters and computing a description of the regions of the space of parameters over which the number of real roots remains invariant.   We design an algorithm for solving this problem.The formulas it outputs enjoy a determinantal structure.Under genericity assumptions, we show that its arithmetic complexity is polynomial in both the maximum degree $d$ and the number $s$ of the input inequalities and exponential in $nt+t^2$.

                  <p>In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied with some confidence indication.Two popular post-processing approaches for that aim are: 1) calibration: modifying the classifier's softmax values such that their maximum (associated with the prediction) better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) conformal prediction (CP): devising a score (based on the softmax values) from which a set of predictions with theoretically guaranteed marginal coverage of the correct class is produced.While in practice both types of indications can be desired, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward filling this gap, in this paper we study the effect of temperature scaling, arguably the most common calibration technique, on prominent CP methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>We start with an extensive empirical study that among other insights shows that, surprisingly, calibration has a detrimental effect on popular adaptive CP methods: it frequently leads to larger prediction sets.Then, we turn to theoretically analyze this behavior.We reveal several mathematical properties of the procedure, according to which we provide a reasoning for the phenomenon.Our study suggests that it may be worthwhile to utilize adaptive CP methods, chosen for their enhanced conditional coverage, based on softmax values prior to (or after canceling) temperature scaling calibration.</p>

                  <p>A filter for inertial-based odometry is a recursive method used to estimate the pose from measurements of ego-motion and relative pose.Currently, there is no known filter that guarantees the computation of a globally optimal solution for the non-linear measurement model.In this paper, we demonstrate that an innovative filter, with the state being $SE_2(3)$ and the $\sqrt{n}$-\textit{consistent} pose as the initialization, efficiently achieves \textit{asymptotic optimality} in terms of minimum mean square error.This approach is tailored for real-time SLAM and inertial-based odometry applications.   Our first contribution is that we propose an iterative filtering method based on the Gauss-Newton method on Lie groups which is numerically to solve the estimation of states from a priori and non-linear measurements.The filtering stands out due to its iterative mechanism and adaptive initialization.Second, when dealing with environmental measurements of the surroundings, we utilize a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent pose as the initial value for the update step in a single iteration.The solution is closed in form and has computational complexity $O(n)$. Third, we theoretically show that the approach can achieve asymptotic optimality in the sense of minimum mean square error from the a priori and virtual relative pose measurements (see Problem~\ref{prob:new update problem}).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, to validate our method, we carry out extensive numerical and experimental evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Our results consistently demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art filter-based methods, including the iterated extended Kalman filter and the invariant extended Kalman filter, in terms of accuracy and running time.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm called Simulated Overparametrization (SOP).SOP merges the computational efficiency of compact models with the advanced learning proficiencies of overparameterized models.SOP proposes a unique approach to model training and inference, where a model with a significantly larger number of parameters is trained in such a way that a smaller, efficient subset of these parameters is used for the actual computation during inference.Building upon this framework, we present a novel, architecture agnostic algorithm called "majority kernels", which seamlessly integrates with predominant architectures, including Transformer models.Majority kernels enables the simulated training of overparameterized models, resulting in performance gains across architectures and tasks.Furthermore, our approach adds minimal overhead to the cost incurred (wall clock time) at training time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed approach shows strong performance on a wide variety of datasets and models, even outperforming strong baselines such as combinatorial optimization methods based on submodular optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graphical models capture relations between entities in a wide range of applications including social networks, biology, and natural language processing, among others.Graph neural networks (GNN) are neural models that operate over graphs, enabling the model to leverage the complex relationships and dependencies in graph-structured data.A graph explanation is a subgraph which is an `almost sufficient' statistic of the input graph with respect to its classification label.Consequently, the classification label is invariant, with high probability, to perturbations of graph edges not belonging to its explanation subgraph.This work considers two methods for leveraging such perturbation invariances in the design and training of GNNs.First, explanation-assisted learning rules are considered.It is shown that the sample complexity of explanation-assisted learning can be arbitrarily smaller than explanation-agnostic learning.Next, explanation-assisted data augmentation is considered, where the training set is enlarged by artificially producing new training samples via perturbation of the non-explanation edges in the original training set.It is shown that such data augmentation methods may improve performance if the augmented data is in-distribution, however, it may also lead to worse sample complexity compared to explanation-agnostic learning rules if the augmented data is out-of-distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evaluations are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we consider a decentralized learning problem in the presence of stragglers.Although gradient coding techniques have been developed for distributed learning to evade stragglers, where the devices send encoded gradients with redundant training data, it is difficult to apply those techniques directly to decentralized learning scenarios.To deal with this problem, we propose a new gossip-based decentralized learning method with gradient coding (GOCO).In the proposed method, to avoid the negative impact of stragglers, the parameter vectors are updated locally using encoded gradients based on the framework of stochastic gradient coding and then averaged in a gossip-based manner.We analyze the convergence performance of GOCO for strongly convex loss functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>And we also provide simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of learning performance compared with the baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces auxiliary parameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited computing resources.But it still faces challenges of resource consumption when scaling up to larger models.Previous studies employ pruning techniques by evaluating the importance of LoRA parameters for different layers to address the problem.However, these efforts only analyzed parameter features to evaluate their importance.Indeed, the output of LoRA related to the parameters and data is the factor that directly impacts the frozen model.To this end, we propose LoRA-drop which evaluates the importance of the parameters by analyzing the LoRA output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We retain LoRA for important layers and the LoRA of the other layers share the same parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Abundant experiments on NLU and NLG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-drop.</p>

                  <p>The latest breakthroughs in large language models (LLM) have empowered software development tools, such as ChatGPT, to aid developers in complex tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers use ChatGPT to write code, review code changes, and even debug their programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>In these interactions, ChatGPT often recommends code snippets that depend on external libraries.However, code from libraries changes over time, invalidating a once-correct code snippet and making it difficult to reuse recommended code.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we analyze DevGPT, a dataset of more than 4,000 Developer-ChatGPT interactions, to understand the role of library versions in code-related conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We quantify how often library version constraints are mentioned in code-related conversations and when ChatGPT recommends the installation of specific libraries.Our findings show that, albeit to constantly recommend and analyze code with external dependencies, library version constraints only appear in 9% of the conversations.In the majority of conversations, the version constraints are prompted by users (as opposed to being specified by ChatGPT) as a method for receiving better quality responses.Moreover, we study how library version constraints are used in the conversation through qualitative methods, identifying several potential problems that warrant further research.</p>

                  <p>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineers are responsible for assessing a product during every phase of the software development process to ensure that the outcomes of each phase and the final product possess the desired qualities.In general, a great SQA engineer needs to have a different set of abilities from development engineers to effectively oversee the entire product development process from beginning to end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent empirical studies identified important attributes of software engineers and managers, but the quality assurance role is overlooked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>As software quality aspects have become more of a priority in the life cycle of software development, employers seek professionals that best suit the company's objectives and new graduates desire to make a valuable contribution through their job as an SQA engineer, but what makes them great?We addressed this knowledge gap by conducting 25 semi-structured interviews and 363 survey respondents with software quality assurance engineers from different companies around the world.We use the data collected from these activities to derive a comprehensive set of attributes that are considered important.As a result of the interviews, twenty-five attributes were identified and grouped into five main categories: personal, social, technical, management, and decision-making attributes.Through a rating survey, we confirmed that the distinguishing characteristics of great SQA engineers are curiosity, the ability to communicate effectively, and critical thinking skills.This work will guide further studies with SQA practitioners, by considering contextual factors and providing some implications for research and practice.</p>
