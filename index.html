                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++.We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>CONTEXT The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing.Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs.At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice.OBJECTIVEIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real-world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used.Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors.We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>METHOD We analyze 4230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19450 CRAN packages for over 350000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.869</span></span>RESULTS We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions.Furthermore, we find neither testing functions nor many calls to R's foreign function interface (FFI) in the publication submissions.CONCLUSION R scripts and package sources differ, for example, in their size, the way they include other packages, and their usage of R's reflective capabilities.We provide features that are used frequently and should be prioritized by static analysis tools, like operator assignments, function calls, and certain reflective functions like load.</p>

                  <p>In the context of rapid advancements in industrial automation, vision-based robotic grasping plays an increasingly crucial role.In order to enhance visual recognition accuracy, the utilization of large-scale datasets is imperative for training models to acquire implicit knowledge related to the handling of various objects.Creating datasets from scratch is a time and labor-intensive process.Moreover, existing datasets often contain errors due to automated annotations aimed at expediency, making the improvement of these datasets a substantial research challenge.Consequently, several issues have been identified in the annotation of grasp bounding boxes within the popular Jacquard Grasp.We propose utilizing a Human-In-The-Loop(HIL) method to enhance dataset quality.This approach relies on backbone deep learning networks to predict object positions and orientations for robotic grasping.Predictions with Intersection over Union (IOU) values below 0.2 undergo an assessment by human operators.After their evaluation, the data is categorized into False Negatives(FN) and True Negatives(TN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FN are then subcategorized into either missing annotations or catastrophic labeling errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Images lacking labels are augmented with valid grasp bounding box information, whereas images afflicted by catastrophic labeling errors are completely removed.The open-source tool Labelbee was employed for 53,026 iterations of HIL dataset enhancement, leading to the removal of 2,884 images and the incorporation of ground truth information for 30,292 images.The enhanced dataset, named the Jacquard V2 Grasping Dataset, served as the training data for a range of neural networks.</p>

                  <p>Generating sufficient labeled data is a significant hurdle in the efficient execution of deep learning projects, especially in uncharted territories of image segmentation where labeling demands extensive time, unlike classification tasks.Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data.Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset.Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques.For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.The full code is available at: https://github.com/MichaelVorndran/InconsistencyMasks</p>

                  <p>In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied with some confidence indication.Two popular post-processing approaches for that aim are: 1) calibration: modifying the classifier's softmax values such that their maximum (associated with the prediction) better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) conformal prediction (CP): devising a score (based on the softmax values) from which a set of predictions with theoretically guaranteed marginal coverage of the correct class is produced.While in practice both types of indications can be desired, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward filling this gap, in this paper we study the effect of temperature scaling, arguably the most common calibration technique, on prominent CP methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>We start with an extensive empirical study that among other insights shows that, surprisingly, calibration has a detrimental effect on popular adaptive CP methods: it frequently leads to larger prediction sets.Then, we turn to theoretically analyze this behavior.We reveal several mathematical properties of the procedure, according to which we provide a reasoning for the phenomenon.Our study suggests that it may be worthwhile to utilize adaptive CP methods, chosen for their enhanced conditional coverage, based on softmax values prior to (or after canceling) temperature scaling calibration.</p>

                  <p>A filter for inertial-based odometry is a recursive method used to estimate the pose from measurements of ego-motion and relative pose.Currently, there is no known filter that guarantees the computation of a globally optimal solution for the non-linear measurement model.In this paper, we demonstrate that an innovative filter, with the state being $SE_2(3)$ and the $\sqrt{n}$-\textit{consistent} pose as the initialization, efficiently achieves \textit{asymptotic optimality} in terms of minimum mean square error.This approach is tailored for real-time SLAM and inertial-based odometry applications.   Our first contribution is that we propose an iterative filtering method based on the Gauss-Newton method on Lie groups which is numerically to solve the estimation of states from a priori and non-linear measurements.The filtering stands out due to its iterative mechanism and adaptive initialization.Second, when dealing with environmental measurements of the surroundings, we utilize a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent pose as the initial value for the update step in a single iteration.The solution is closed in form and has computational complexity $O(n)$. Third, we theoretically show that the approach can achieve asymptotic optimality in the sense of minimum mean square error from the a priori and virtual relative pose measurements (see Problem~\ref{prob:new update problem}).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, to validate our method, we carry out extensive numerical and experimental evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Our results consistently demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art filter-based methods, including the iterated extended Kalman filter and the invariant extended Kalman filter, in terms of accuracy and running time.</p>

                  <p>Graphical models capture relations between entities in a wide range of applications including social networks, biology, and natural language processing, among others.Graph neural networks (GNN) are neural models that operate over graphs, enabling the model to leverage the complex relationships and dependencies in graph-structured data.A graph explanation is a subgraph which is an `almost sufficient' statistic of the input graph with respect to its classification label.Consequently, the classification label is invariant, with high probability, to perturbations of graph edges not belonging to its explanation subgraph.This work considers two methods for leveraging such perturbation invariances in the design and training of GNNs.First, explanation-assisted learning rules are considered.It is shown that the sample complexity of explanation-assisted learning can be arbitrarily smaller than explanation-agnostic learning.Next, explanation-assisted data augmentation is considered, where the training set is enlarged by artificially producing new training samples via perturbation of the non-explanation edges in the original training set.It is shown that such data augmentation methods may improve performance if the augmented data is in-distribution, however, it may also lead to worse sample complexity compared to explanation-agnostic learning rules if the augmented data is out-of-distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evaluations are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span></p>

                  <p>Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks.Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs).As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands.Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests.A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content.Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm.Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

                  <p>In model-based reinforcement learning, most algorithms rely on simulating trajectories from one-step models of the dynamics learned on data.A critical challenge of this approach is the compounding of one-step prediction errors as the length of the trajectory grows.In this paper we tackle this issue by using a multi-step objective to train one-step models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our objective is a weighted sum of the mean squared error (MSE) loss at various future horizons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We find that this new loss is particularly useful when the data is noisy (additive Gaussian noise in the observations), which is often the case in real-life environments.To support the multi-step loss, first we study its properties in two tractable cases: i) uni-dimensional linear system, and ii) two-parameter non-linear system.Second, we show in a variety of tasks (environments or datasets) that the models learned with this loss achieve a significant improvement in terms of the averaged R2-score on future prediction horizons.Finally, in the pure batch reinforcement learning setting, we demonstrate that one-step models serve as strong baselines when dynamics are deterministic, while multi-step models would be more advantageous in the presence of noise, highlighting the potential of our approach in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Recent text-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive progress.In practice, users often desire the ability to control object motion and camera movement independently for customized video creation.However, current methods lack the focus on separately controlling object motion and camera movement in a decoupled manner, which limits the controllability and flexibility of text-to-video models.In this paper, we introduce Direct-a-Video, a system that allows users to independently specify motions for one or multiple objects and/or camera movements, as if directing a video.We propose a simple yet effective strategy for the decoupled control of object motion and camera movement.Object motion is controlled through spatial cross-attention modulation using the model's inherent priors, requiring no additional optimization.For camera movement, we introduce new temporal cross-attention layers to interpret quantitative camera movement parameters.We further employ an augmentation-based approach to train these layers in a self-supervised manner on a small-scale dataset, eliminating the need for explicit motion annotation.Both components operate independently, allowing individual or combined control, and can generalize to open-domain scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>Project page: https://direct-a-video.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL.</p>

                  <p>It is common to observe performance degradation when transferring models trained on some (source) datasets to target testing data due to a domain gap between them.Existing methods for bridging this gap, such as domain adaptation (DA), may require the source data on which the model was trained (often not available), while others, i.e., source-free DA, require many passes through the testing data.We propose an online test-time adaptation method for depth completion, the task of inferring a dense depth map from a single image and associated sparse depth map, that closes the performance gap in a single pass.We first present a study on how the domain shift in each data modality affects model performance.Based on our observations that the sparse depth modality exhibits a much smaller covariate shift than the image, we design an embedding module trained in the source domain that preserves a mapping from features encoding only sparse depth to those encoding image and sparse depth.During test time, sparse depth features are projected using this map as a proxy for source domain features and are used as guidance to train a set of auxiliary parameters (i.e., adaptation layer) to align image and sparse depth features from the target test domain to that of the source domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that it improves over baselines by an average of 21.1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Early time classification algorithms aim to label a stream of features without processing the full input stream, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that achieved by applying the classifier to the entire input.In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework that can be applied to any sequential classifier, formulating a calibrated stopping rule.This data-driven rule attains finite-sample, distribution-free control of the accuracy gap between full and early-time classification.We start by presenting a novel method that builds on the Learn-then-Test calibration framework to control this gap marginally, on average over i.i.d. instances.As this algorithm tends to yield an excessively high accuracy gap for early halt times, our main contribution is the proposal of a framework that controls a stronger notion of error, where the accuracy gap is controlled conditionally on the accumulated halt times.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, applicability, and usefulness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We show that our proposed early stopping mechanism reduces up to 94% of timesteps used for classification while achieving rigorous accuracy gap control.</p>

                  <p>The latest breakthroughs in large language models (LLM) have empowered software development tools, such as ChatGPT, to aid developers in complex tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers use ChatGPT to write code, review code changes, and even debug their programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>In these interactions, ChatGPT often recommends code snippets that depend on external libraries.However, code from libraries changes over time, invalidating a once-correct code snippet and making it difficult to reuse recommended code.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we analyze DevGPT, a dataset of more than 4,000 Developer-ChatGPT interactions, to understand the role of library versions in code-related conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We quantify how often library version constraints are mentioned in code-related conversations and when ChatGPT recommends the installation of specific libraries.Our findings show that, albeit to constantly recommend and analyze code with external dependencies, library version constraints only appear in 9% of the conversations.In the majority of conversations, the version constraints are prompted by users (as opposed to being specified by ChatGPT) as a method for receiving better quality responses.Moreover, we study how library version constraints are used in the conversation through qualitative methods, identifying several potential problems that warrant further research.</p>

                  <p>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineers are responsible for assessing a product during every phase of the software development process to ensure that the outcomes of each phase and the final product possess the desired qualities.In general, a great SQA engineer needs to have a different set of abilities from development engineers to effectively oversee the entire product development process from beginning to end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent empirical studies identified important attributes of software engineers and managers, but the quality assurance role is overlooked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>As software quality aspects have become more of a priority in the life cycle of software development, employers seek professionals that best suit the company's objectives and new graduates desire to make a valuable contribution through their job as an SQA engineer, but what makes them great?We addressed this knowledge gap by conducting 25 semi-structured interviews and 363 survey respondents with software quality assurance engineers from different companies around the world.We use the data collected from these activities to derive a comprehensive set of attributes that are considered important.As a result of the interviews, twenty-five attributes were identified and grouped into five main categories: personal, social, technical, management, and decision-making attributes.Through a rating survey, we confirmed that the distinguishing characteristics of great SQA engineers are curiosity, the ability to communicate effectively, and critical thinking skills.This work will guide further studies with SQA practitioners, by considering contextual factors and providing some implications for research and practice.</p>
