                  <p>Existing person re-identification methods have achieved remarkable advances in appearance-based identity association across homogeneous cameras, such as ground-ground matching.However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received minimal attention.To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework.Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two features inside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consisting of five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution for AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computational complexity.Our project is available at https://github.com/LinlyAC/VDT-AGPReID</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore the utility of \textit{Translationese} as synthetic data created using machine translation for pre-training language models (LMs).Pre-training requires vast amounts of monolingual data, which is mostly unavailable for languages other than English.Recently, there has been a growing interest in using synthetic data to address this data scarcity.We take the case of English and Indic languages and translate web-crawled monolingual documents (clean) into the target language.Then, we train language models containing 28M and 85M parameters on this translationese data (synthetic).We show that their performance on downstream natural language understanding and generative tasks is only 3.56\% poorer on NLU tasks and 1.51\% on NLG tasks than LMs pre-trained on clean data.Further, we propose the use of lightweight \textit{TinyLMs} pre-trained on clean data to filter synthetic data efficiently which significantly improves the performance of our models.We also find that LMs trained on synthetic data strongly benefit from extended pretraining on a tiny fraction (10\%) of clean data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the data we collected and created as a part of this work, \textit{IndicMonoDoc}, the largest collection of monolingual document-level corpora, which we hope will help bridge the gap between English and non-English performance for large language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their outstanding performance in various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.However, low-resource languages are still lagging behind current state-of-the-art (SOTA) developments in the field of NLP due to insufficient resources to train LLMs.Ethiopian languages exhibit remarkable linguistic diversity, encompassing a wide array of scripts, and are imbued with profound religious and cultural significance.This paper introduces EthioLLM -- multilingual large language models for five Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Ge'ez, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya) and English, and Ethiobenchmark -- a new benchmark dataset for various downstream NLP tasks.We evaluate the performance of these models across five downstream NLP tasks.We open-source our multilingual language models, new benchmark datasets for various downstream tasks, and task-specific fine-tuned language models and discuss the performance of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and models are available at the https://huggingface.co/EthioNLP repository. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic Assisted Feeding (RAF) addresses the fundamental need for individuals with mobility impairments to regain autonomy in feeding themselves.The goal of RAF is to use a robot arm to acquire and transfer food to individuals from the table.Existing RAF methods primarily focus on solid foods, leaving a gap in manipulation strategies for semi-solid and deformable foods.This study introduces Long-horizon Visual Action (LAVA) based food acquisition of liquid, semisolid, and deformable foods.Long-horizon refers to the goal of "clearing the bowl" by sequentially acquiring the food from the bowl.LAVA employs a hierarchical policy for long-horizon food acquisition tasks.The framework uses high-level policy to determine primitives by leveraging ScoopNet.At the mid-level, LAVA finds parameters for primitives using vision.To carry out sequential plans in the real world, LAVA delegates action execution which is driven by Low-level policy that uses parameters received from mid-level policy and behavior cloning ensuring precise trajectory execution.We validate our approach on complex real-world acquisition trials involving granular, liquid, semisolid, and deformable food types along with fruit chunks and soup acquisition.Across 46 bowls, LAVA acquires much more efficiently than baselines with a success rate of 89 +/- 4% and generalizes across realistic plate variations such as different positions, varieties, and amount of food in the bowl.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, videos, and supplementary materials can be found on our website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Estimating human and camera trajectories with accurate scale in the world coordinate system from a monocular video is a highly desirable yet challenging and ill-posed problem.In this study, we aim to recover expressive parametric human models (i.e., SMPL-X) and corresponding camera poses jointly, by leveraging the synergy between three critical players: the world, the human, and the camera.Our approach is founded on two key observations.Firstly, camera-frame SMPL-X estimation methods readily recover absolute human depth.Secondly, human motions inherently provide absolute spatial cues.By integrating these insights, we introduce a novel framework, referred to as WHAC, to facilitate world-grounded expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) alongside camera pose estimation, without relying on traditional optimization techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present a new synthetic dataset, WHAC-A-Mole, which includes accurately annotated humans and cameras, and features diverse interactive human motions as well as realistic camera trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>Extensive experiments on both standard and newly established benchmarks highlight the superiority and efficacy of our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the code and dataset publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset.We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Typical LiDAR-based 3D object detection models are trained in a supervised manner with real-world data collection, which is often imbalanced over classes (or long-tailed).To deal with it, augmenting minority-class examples by sampling ground truth (GT) LiDAR points from a database and pasting them into a scene of interest is often used, but challenges still remain: inflexibility in locating GT samples and limited sample diversity.In this work, we propose to leverage pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated (at a low cost) from videos capturing a surround view of miniatures or real-world objects of minor classes.Our method, called Pseudo Ground Truth Augmentation (PGT-Aug), consists of three main steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity estimation and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information.We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reconstructing photo-realistic drivable human avatars from multi-view image sequences has been a popular and challenging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics.While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are time-consuming.Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the human body, enabling faster training and rendering.However, they undermine the importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with coarse mesh guidance.This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and tends to produce blurry textures.Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space Gaussian textures.We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to extract features.Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian rendering and significantly enhancing rendering quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect and process a new dataset of human motion, which includes multi-view images, scanned models, parametric model registration, and corresponding texture maps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art synthesis of novel view and novel pose.The code and data will be made available on the homepage https://alex-jyj.github.io/UV-Gaussians/ once the paper is accepted.</p>

                  <p>The study of music-generated dance is a novel and challenging Image generation task.It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then generate natural dance movements for the subsequent music.Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects.This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music.In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module.First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance.Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation.Finally, we conducted experiments on the dataset AIST++, and the results show that our approach achieves better and more robust performance in generating accurate, high-quality dance movements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be available from https://github.com/MarasyZZ/QEAN and https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question.This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers.However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question.As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization.In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation.RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information.To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking.Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question.This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers.However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question.As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization.In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation.RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information.To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem.</p>

                  <p>Quantifying the semantic similarity between database queries is a critical challenge with broad applications, ranging from query log analysis to automated educational assessment of SQL skills.Traditional methods often rely solely on syntactic comparisons or are limited to checking for semantic equivalence.   This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to measure the semantic dissimilarity between SQL queries.Queries are represented as nodes in an implicit graph, while the transitions between nodes are called edits, which are weighted by semantic dissimilarity.We employ shortest path algorithms to identify the lowest-cost edit sequence between two given queries, thereby defining a quantifiable measure of semantic distance.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A prototype implementation of this technique has been evaluated through an empirical study, which strongly suggests that our method provides more accurate and comprehensible grading compared to existing techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the results indicate that our approach comes close to the quality of manual grading, making it a robust tool for diverse database query comparison tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks is crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significant financial interests heighten the risk of such attacks.Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted on glass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment.The digital analysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size and multi-resolution storage format.In this work, we aim at improving the robustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarial attacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels.As regards the proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based model which utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs.A denoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage the impact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs.The process concludes with a transformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based on the processed data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Initially, we trained and tested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed to any attack.We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graph level and processed them through the proposed network.The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores.The results from this comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling adversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have unlocked powerful image manipulation capabilities.However, applying these methods to real images necessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretrained diffusion model.Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularly for more recent models trained to generate images with a small number of denoising steps.In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a high quality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without increasing the number of operations.Building on reversing the diffusion sampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at each inversion sampling step.This mechanism refines the approximation of a predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applying the pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions.We evaluate the performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms and models, including recent accelerated diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>Furthermore, we confirm that our method preserves editability by demonstrating text-driven image editing on real images.</p>

                  <p>Acquiring and utilizing accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly improve transmission performance, thereby holding a crucial role in realizing the potential advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology.Current prevailing CSI feedback approaches improve precision by employing advanced deep-learning methods to learn representative CSI features for a subsequent compression process.Diverging from previous works, we treat the CSI compression problem in the context of implicit neural representations.Specifically, each CSI matrix is viewed as a neural function that maps the CSI coordinates (antenna number and subchannel) to the corresponding channel gains.Instead of transmitting the parameters of the implicit neural functions directly, we transmit modulations based on the CSI matrix derived through a meta-learning algorithm.Modulations are then applied to a shared base network to generate the elements of the CSI matrix.Modulations corresponding to the CSI matrix are quantized and entropy-coded to further reduce the communication bandwidth, thus achieving extreme CSI compression ratios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and showcases flexibility in feedback strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Locomotion mechanics of legged robots are suitable when pacing through difficult terrains.Recognising terrains for such robots are important to fully yoke the versatility of their movements.Consequently, robotic terrain classification becomes significant to classify terrains in real time with high accuracy.The conventional classifiers suffer from overfitting problem, low accuracy problem, high variance problem, and not suitable for live dataset.On the other hand, classifying a growing dataset is difficult for convolution based terrain classification.Supervised recurrent models are also not practical for this classification.Further, the existing recurrent architectures are still evolving to improve accuracy of terrain classification based on live variable-length sensory data collected from legged robots.This paper proposes a new semi-supervised method for terrain classification of legged robots, avoiding preprocessing of long variable-length dataset.The proposed method has a stacked Long Short-Term Memory architecture, including a new loss regularization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method solves the existing problems and improves accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comparison with the existing architectures show the improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Strategy logic (SL) is a powerful temporal logic that enables strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems.SL supports explicit (first-order) quantification over strategies and provides a logical framework to express many important properties such as Nash equilibria, dominant strategies, etc.While in SL the same strategy can be used in multiple strategy profiles, each such profile is evaluated w.r.t.a path-property, i.e., a property that considers the single path resulting from a particular strategic interaction.In this paper, we present Hyper Strategy Logic (HyperSL), a strategy logic where the outcome of multiple strategy profiles can be compared w.r.t.a hyperproperty, i.e., a property that relates multiple paths.We show that HyperSL can capture important properties that cannot be expressed in SL, including non-interference, quantitative Nash equilibria, optimal adversarial planning, and reasoning under imperfect information.On the algorithmic side, we identify an expressive fragment of HyperSL with decidable model checking and present a model-checking algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a prototype implementation of our algorithm and report on encouraging experimental results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditionally, segmentation algorithms require dense annotations for training, demanding significant annotation efforts, particularly within the 3D medical imaging field.Scribble-supervised learning emerges as a possible solution to this challenge, promising a reduction in annotation efforts when creating large-scale datasets.Recently, a plethora of methods for optimized learning from scribbles have been proposed, but have so far failed to position scribble annotation as a beneficial alternative.We relate this shortcoming to two major issues: 1) the complex nature of many methods which deeply ties them to the underlying segmentation model, thus preventing a migration to more powerful state-of-the-art models as the field progresses and 2) the lack of a systematic evaluation to validate consistent performance across the broader medical domain, resulting in a lack of trust when applying these methods to new segmentation problems.To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive scribble supervision benchmark consisting of seven datasets covering a diverse set of anatomies and pathologies imaged with varying modalities.We furthermore propose the systematic use of partial losses, i.e. losses that are only computed on annotated voxels.Contrary to most existing methods, these losses can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art segmentation methods, enabling them to learn from scribble annotations while preserving their original loss formulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation using nnU-Net reveals that while most existing methods suffer from a lack of generalization, the proposed approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Thanks to its simplicity, our approach presents an embarrassingly simple yet effective solution to the challenges of scribble supervision.Source code as well as our extensive scribble benchmarking suite will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Released Large Language Models (LLMs) are often paired with a claimed knowledge cutoff date, or the dates at which training data was gathered.Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to date information.However, this statement only scratches the surface: do all resources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date?Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoff dates?In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff.This is distinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately to sub-resources and topics.We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing across versions of the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often differ from reported cutoffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets.Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates.Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information from these models.</p>

                  <p>Estimating human and camera trajectories with accurate scale in the world coordinate system from a monocular video is a highly desirable yet challenging and ill-posed problem.In this study, we aim to recover expressive parametric human models (i.e., SMPL-X) and corresponding camera poses jointly, by leveraging the synergy between three critical players: the world, the human, and the camera.Our approach is founded on two key observations.Firstly, camera-frame SMPL-X estimation methods readily recover absolute human depth.Secondly, human motions inherently provide absolute spatial cues.By integrating these insights, we introduce a novel framework, referred to as WHAC, to facilitate world-grounded expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) alongside camera pose estimation, without relying on traditional optimization techniques.Additionally, we present a new synthetic dataset, WHAC-A-Mole, which includes accurately annotated humans and cameras, and features diverse interactive human motions as well as realistic camera trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on both standard and newly established benchmarks highlight the superiority and efficacy of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We will make the code and dataset publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models.Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data.However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks.In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct.The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action.When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales.Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action.In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training.Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement.We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds.In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Creating suitable diagrams for technical and scientific publications is challenging and time-consuming, as manual control over the layout is required to communicate information effectively.Existing diagramming tools usually allow modeling the diagrams via a textual domain-specific language (DSL) that can be rendered and auto-layouted or via a graphical editor.While auto-layout is fast, the results are often not satisfying for most publications.However, graphical editors are time-consuming to create large diagrams.The blended or hybrid modeling concept enables creating diagrams efficiently using a DSL and editing the rendered diagram via the graphical editor for fine-tuning.However, hybrid modeling editors are limited to individual diagram types and do not save the layout and style information in the textual description.Therefore, we propose HyLiMo, a hybrid live-synchronized modular diagramming editor.In HyLiMo, diagrams are created using an internal DSL and live synchronized with an interactive graphical editor for the rendered diagram, allowing a straightforward layout and style change, which is stored in the DSL code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HyLiMo is independent of specific diagram types, but we offer specific functionality for UML class diagrams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Using the language server protocol, we implement it as a web app and IDE extension.The results of our user study indicate that such an approach enables fast and precise diagramming.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>
