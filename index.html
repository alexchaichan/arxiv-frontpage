                  <p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a complicated task that requires the capability of simultaneously processing natural language and images.Initially, this task was researched, focusing on methods to help machines understand objects and scene contexts in images.However, some text appearing in the image that carries explicit information about the full content of the image is not mentioned.Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been many studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world.As a developing country, conditions are still limited, and this task is still open in Vietnam.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese specializing in the ability to understand text appearing in images, we call it ViTextVQA (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Text}-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \textbf{over 16,000} images and \textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Through meticulous experiments with various state-of-the-art models, we uncover the significance of the order in which tokens in OCR text are processed and selected to formulate answers.This finding helped us significantly improve the performance of the baseline models on the ViTextVQA dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at this \href{https://github.com/minhquan6203/ViTextVQA-Dataset}{link} for research purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark.Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass.Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction.To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering.We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering.We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices.Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures.This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality.Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Wikipedia is the largest web repository of free knowledge.Volunteer editors devote time and effort to creating and expanding articles in more than 300 language editions.As content quality varies from article to article, editors also spend substantial time rating articles with specific criteria.However, keeping these assessments complete and up-to-date is largely impossible given the ever-changing nature of Wikipedia.To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel computational framework for modeling the quality of Wikipedia articles.   State-of-the-art approaches to model Wikipedia article quality have leveraged machine learning techniques with language-specific features.In contrast, our framework is based on language-agnostic structural features extracted from the articles, a set of universal weights, and a language version-specific normalization criterion.Therefore, we ensure that all language editions of Wikipedia can benefit from our framework, even those that do not have their own quality assessment scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this framework, we have built datasets with the feature values and quality scores of all revisions of all articles in the existing language versions of Wikipedia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>We provide a descriptive analysis of these resources and a benchmark of our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we discuss possible downstream tasks to be addressed with these datasets, which are released for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress in image denoising, it is still challenging to restore fine-scale details while removing noise, especially in extremely low-light environments.Leveraging near-infrared (NIR) images to assist visible RGB image denoising shows the potential to address this issue, becoming a promising technology.Nonetheless, existing works still struggle with taking advantage of NIR information effectively for real-world image denoising, due to the content inconsistency between NIR-RGB images and the scarcity of real-world paired datasets.To alleviate the problem, we propose an efficient Selective Fusion Module (SFM), which can be plug-and-played into the advanced denoising networks to merge the deep NIR-RGB features.Specifically, we sequentially perform the global and local modulation for NIR and RGB features, and then integrate the two modulated features.Furthermore, we present a Real-world NIR-Assisted Image Denoising (Real-NAID) dataset, which covers diverse scenarios as well as various noise levels.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and our real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to understand the visual objects and their semantic relationships from one given image.Until now, lots of SGG datasets with the eyelevel view are released but the SGG dataset with the overhead view is scarcely studied.By contrast to the object occlusion problem in the eyelevel view, which impedes the SGG, the overhead view provides a new perspective that helps to promote the SGG by providing a clear perception of the spatial relationships of objects in the ground scene.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill in the gap of the overhead view dataset, this paper constructs and releases an aerial image urban scene graph generation (AUG) dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Images from the AUG dataset are captured with the low-attitude overhead view.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the AUG dataset, 25,594 objects, 16,970 relationships, and 27,175 attributes are manually annotated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>To avoid the local context being overwhelmed in the complex aerial urban scene, this paper proposes one new locality-preserving graph convolutional network (LPG).Different from the traditional graph convolutional network, which has the natural advantage of capturing the global context for SGG, the convolutional layer in the LPG integrates the non-destructive initial features of the objects with dynamically updated neighborhood information to preserve the local context under the premise of mining the global context.To address the problem that there exists an extra-large number of potential object relationship pairs but only a small part of them is meaningful in AUG, we propose the adaptive bounding box scaling factor for potential relationship detection (ABS-PRD) to intelligently prune the meaningless relationship pairs.Extensive experiments on the AUG dataset show that our LPG can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of the proposed locality-preserving strategy.</p>

                  <p>Cross-lingual transfer-learning is widely used in Event Extraction for low-resource languages and involves a Multilingual Language Model that is trained in a source language and applied to the target language.This paper studies whether the typological similarity between source and target languages impacts the performance of cross-lingual transfer, an under-explored topic.We first focus on Basque as the target language, which is an ideal target language because it is typologically different from surrounding languages.Our experiments on three Event Extraction tasks show that the shared linguistic characteristic between source and target languages does have an impact on transfer quality.Further analysis of 72 language pairs reveals that for tasks that involve token classification such as entity and event trigger identification, common writing script and morphological features produce higher quality cross-lingual transfer.In contrast, for tasks involving structural prediction like argument extraction, common word order is the most relevant feature.In addition, we show that when increasing the training size, not all the languages scale in the same way in the cross-lingual setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To perform the experiments we introduce EusIE, an event extraction dataset for Basque, which follows the Multilingual Event Extraction dataset (MEE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span></p>

                  <p>While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists.Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views.Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold.First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back).Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered.This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator.In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts.We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a new self-supervised approach, SelfPose3d, for estimating 3d poses of multiple persons from multiple camera views.Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods, our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator.We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation.We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points, serving as 3d person root positions, and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views.We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation, map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints, and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner.Afterwards, we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels, we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Our experiments and analysis on three public benchmark datasets, including Panoptic, Shelf, and Campus, show the effectiveness of our approach, which is comparable to fully-supervised methods.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SelfPose3D}</p>

                  <p>Getting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on the downstream tasks requires pre-training over trillions of tokens.This typically demands a large number of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed training framework to accelerate the training.The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML had led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which begs the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient.AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator that has been purposely built for training large deep learning models.Its corresponding instance, Amazon EC2 trn1, is an alternative to GPU instances for LLM training.However, training LLMs with billions of parameters on trn1 is challenging due to its relatively nascent software ecosystem.In this paper, we showcase HLAT: a 7 billion parameter decoder-only LLM pre-trained using trn1 instances over 1.8 trillion tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular open source baseline models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been trained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>On various evaluation tasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines.We also share the best practice of using the Neuron Distributed Training Library (NDTL), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium to achieve efficient training.Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by the NDTL is able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase.This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the code submitted, as well as the author's and the reviewer's experience, leading to median wait times for review feedback of 15-64 hours.Through an initial user study carried with 29 experts, we found that re-ordering the files changed by a patch within the review environment has potential to improve review quality, as more comments are written (+23%), and participants' file-level hot-spot precision and recall increases to 53% (+13%) and 28% (+8%), respectively, compared to the alphanumeric ordering.Hence, this paper aims to help code reviewers by predicting which files in a submitted patch need to be (1) commented, (2) revised, or (3) are hot-spots (commented or revised).To predict these tasks, we evaluate two different types of text embeddings (i.e., Bag-of-Words and Large Language Models encoding) and review process features (i.e., code size-based and history-based features).Our empirical study on three open-source and two industrial datasets shows that combining the code embedding and review process features leads to better results than the state-of-the-art approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For all tasks, F1-scores (median of 40-62%) are significantly better than the state-of-the-art (from +1 to +9%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Regular transition systems (RTS) are a popular formalism for modeling infinite-state systems in general, and parameterised systems in particular.In a CONCUR 22 paper, Esparza et al. introduce a novel approach to the verification of RTS, based on inductive invariants.The approach computes the intersection of all inductive invariants of a given RTS that can be expressed as CNF formulas with a bounded number of clauses, and uses it to construct an automaton recognising an overapproximation of the reachable configurations.The paper shows that the problem of deciding if the language of this automaton intersects a given regular set of unsafe configurations is in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ and $\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard.   We introduce $\textit{regular abstraction frameworks}$, a generalisation of the approach of Esparza et al., very similar to the regular abstractions of Hong and Lin.A framework consists of a regular language of $\textit{constraints}$, and a transducer, called the $\textit{interpretation}$, that assigns to each constraint the set of configurations of the RTS satisfying it.Examples of regular abstraction frameworks include the formulas of Esparza et al., octagons, bounded difference matrices, and views.We show that the generalisation of the decision problem above to regular abstraction frameworks remains in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$, and prove a matching (highly non-trivial) $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness bound.   $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness implies that, in the worst case, the automaton recognising the overapproximation of the reachable configurations has a double-exponential number of states.We introduce a learning algorithm that computes this automaton in a lazy manner, stopping whenever the current hypothesis is already strong enough to prove safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report on an implementation and show that our experimental results improve on those of Esparza et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper studies the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a computational scheme in which data are encoded using high-dimensional binary vectors.We establish a result about the similarity structure induced by the HDC binding operator and show that the Laplace kernel naturally arises in this setting, motivating our new encoding method Laplace-HDC, which improves upon previous methods.We describe how our results indicate limitations of binary HDC in encoding spatial information from images and discuss potential solutions, including using Haar convolutional features and the definition of a translation-equivariant HDC encoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Several numerical experiments highlighting the improved accuracy of Laplace-HDC in contrast to alternative methods are presented. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>We also numerically study other aspects of the proposed framework such as robustness and the underlying translation-equivariant encoding.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a new research direction for online Multi-Level Aggregation (MLA) with delays.In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$, and we have to serve a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices in an online manner.Each request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)$ and location $l(r)$ (a vertex).Once a request $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t > t(r)$. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, and the service cost of a service corresponds to the weight of the subtree that contains all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t >t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized.The current best algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$ (Azar and Touitou, FOCS'19), where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.   Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process.We present a deterministic online algorithm which achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices.This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that ``single-minded" or ``sample-average" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.</p>

Replay Ratio or Update-To-Data ratio).To show its generality, we evaluate $3$ MARL methods on $6$ SMAC tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results validate that a higher replay ratio significantly improves the sample efficiency for MARL algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>The codes to reimplement the results presented in this paper are open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rr_for_MARL-0D83/.</p>

                  <p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms acquire sequential behavioral patterns through interactions with the environment, their effectiveness in noisy and high-dimensional scenarios typically relies on specific structural priors.In this paper, we propose a novel and general Structural Information principles-based framework for effective Decision-Making, namely SIDM, approached from an information-theoretic perspective.This paper presents a specific unsupervised partitioning method that forms vertex communities in the state and action spaces based on their feature similarities.An aggregation function, which utilizes structural entropy as the vertex weight, is devised within each community to obtain its embedding, thereby facilitating hierarchical state and action abstractions.By extracting abstract elements from historical trajectories, a directed, weighted, homogeneous transition graph is constructed.The minimization of this graph's high-dimensional entropy leads to the generation of an optimal encoding tree.An innovative two-layer skill-based learning mechanism is introduced to compute the common path entropy of each state transition as its identified probability, thereby obviating the requirement for expert knowledge.Moreover, SIDM can be flexibly incorporated into various single-agent and multi-agent RL algorithms, enhancing their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with SOTA baselines, our framework significantly and consistently improves the policy's quality, stability, and efficiency up to 32.70%, 88.26%, and 64.86%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>$\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect.Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients.$\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831).LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2.Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2.Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements.We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis.$\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P<0.01).For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772.In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>$\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net achieved high performance in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</p>

                  <p>Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc.However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms.This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings.For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs.Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models.Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices.Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis.On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in > 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.Code is available at https://github.com/rishabh-ranjan/post-hoc-reversal.</p>

                  <p>Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.Quantum processors and cloud services have been made world-wide increasingly available.Unfortunately, programs on existing quantum processors are often executed in series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor.Typically, one has to wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum program on public quantum cloud due to long queue time.In fact, as the scale grows, the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish, causing the waste of quantum resources.In this paper, to our best knowledge for the first time, the Quantum Program Scheduling Problem (QPSP) is formulated and introduced to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources.Specifically, a quantum program scheduling method concerning the circuit width, number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum programs is proposed to reduce the execution latency.We conduct extensive experiments on a simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek) superconducting quantum processor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results show the effectiveness in both QPU time and turnaround time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios.Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains.However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost.More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm.In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding.Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality.This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors.Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

                  <p>Matching cost aggregation plays a fundamental role in learning-based multi-view stereo networks.However, directly aggregating adjacent costs can lead to suboptimal results due to local geometric inconsistency.Related methods either seek selective aggregation or improve aggregated depth in the 2D space, both are unable to handle geometric inconsistency in the cost volume effectively.In this paper, we propose GoMVS to aggregate geometrically consistent costs, yielding better utilization of adjacent geometries.More specifically, we correspond and propagate adjacent costs to the reference pixel by leveraging the local geometric smoothness in conjunction with surface normals.We achieve this by the geometric consistent propagation (GCP) module.It computes the correspondence from the adjacent depth hypothesis space to the reference depth space using surface normals, then uses the correspondence to propagate adjacent costs to the reference geometry, followed by a convolution for aggregation.Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temple, and ETH3D datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our method ranks 1st on the Tanks & Temple Advanced benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                Unveiling Imitation Learning: Exploring the Impact of Data Falsity to Large Language Model

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

                  <p>Citation Text Generation (CTG) is a task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to produce text that accurately cites or references a cited document within a source document.In CTG, the generated text draws upon contextual cues from both the source document and the cited paper, ensuring accurate and relevant citation information is provided.Previous work in the field of citation generation is mainly based on the text summarization of documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Following this, this paper presents a framework, and a comparative study to demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of citation generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, we have shown the improvement in the results of citation generation by incorporating the knowledge graph relations of the papers in the prompt for the LLM to better learn the relationship between the papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To assess how well our model is performing, we have used a subset of standard S2ORC dataset, which only consists of computer science academic research papers in the English Language.Vicuna performs best for this task with 14.15 Meteor, 12.88 Rouge-1, 1.52 Rouge-2, and10.94 Rouge-L.
